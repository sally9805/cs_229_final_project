0	Female or Male they go to warm places where temperature go up to 80 degrees. They always go to warmer places
0	I think it doesn't mater
0	The temperature changes the gender because when they are first laid they sea turtles are are not formed. The sea turtles are really unidentified
1	The graph provided with the investigation shows that commonly the higher temperature sands normally have hatching female turtles unlike hatching male turtles that do their thing in colder sands. Now in the graph, some male turtles hatch in warmer sands than female hatching turtles but not as often as the other way around. I still stick with my decision with true with my reasons conveniently said and the graph for evidence
0	Most of the monarchs are still caterpillars because it takes a long time to create a chrysalis,and since it takes long to make a chrysalis it is partly true.But if we did the same but with only chrysalis we will see that its just in the middle.
0	i think it is true partly true and partly false because if they are in a really cold environment it probably would affect it when it comes out but it is partly not because when they are in the crystalline it can not affect them as much as when they come out
1	because in the hotter temperature the female eggs hatched
0	I believe this claim is false. I believe it to be false because in the graph you can clearly see there is nearly an equivalent amount of male and female leatherback hatching. In addition, they are hatched in the same temperature range of about 80 to 85 Fahrenheit.
0	sample #7 is almost the exact same top as #60
0	the sands temperature in the ocean shore affects if  it will be a boy or a girl who will hatch from the   turtles egg.
1	in the lower temperature there are mainly males till 84.20 then it is mixed till 85.42 where the rest are al female
0	I think it is false because if an egg is laying playa sand it can come out as a female or male because if you look at the chart and look at what gender is next to playa sand it will say either female or male, not just male, not not just female. Same to do with the Surname sand.
0	I think this claim is true because if its cold the butterflies are gonna want to be in their Chrysalis. Like when you are cold you wouldn't want to be outside in the cold you want to be raped up in your blanket cause its warmer.
0	i said no because it says on the top temperature 85.80 and its a female and on the 2nd one down is says 85.04 and its a male
0	butterfly's like the awareness but it does not help them grow does the awareness help us grow we like it like butterfly's it does not help us grow.
1	the monarch is a caterpillar when it is below 59 degrees and its a chrysalis when it is 59 degrees or higher.  But not always, #3 was a caterpillar while it was 59.36 degrees and #29 was still a cater pillar when it was 60.90 degrees.
1	Because some male temps are low that means that females are high temps. But some males are quite high in temps.
0	I think this is true because if it is super cold outside the butter fly will be very cold and might freeze to death.  But if it is to hot the butter fly might die of heat.
1	The females are usually hotter.
0	Most eggs don't hatch with warm weather but they also can hatch themselves.
0	because it starts from caterpillar to chrysalis, then it ends with a caterpillar not a butterfly.
1	In Playa most of the females sand temperature is higher than the males sand temperature. Like number 1 Playa 85.80 was a female. then number 8 at Playa 80.67 was a male. So it must make a difference if the temperature of the sand is high or low because almost all of the lower ones are male and most of the higher ones are female.
0	i don't know you tell me
0	because i feel like it is true and
1	84.20 and up is almost all female
1	if it is warm out it will change faster than if it is cold
1	"For the first 2 data reports, both ""butterflies"" were outside. 2\'s butterfly was outside in warmer weather, and was a chrysalis already. 1\'s butterfly\'s was in a cooler weather than 2 so warmer weather does speed up the life cycle of a butterfly."
1	I think this is true because if you look at the temperatures 84 degrees and up are all females and if you look at the male temperatures they are all 86 and under.
0	The reason why is because heat can change how will it goes thought it's cycle because it can shell up and it could die in the cold due to the texture drop.
0	sometimes it did turn into a chrysalis, and sometimes it didn't. Iv'e heard that it depends how much food it has.
1	because when in the higher temperatures the insect is mostly in the caterpillar stage and when it's in the lower temp they're mostly in the chrysalis stage but in some parts of the table that is not true.
1	The temperature of the monarch butterfly's habitat can kind of affect how fast they change if the conditions are to hot they might form faster than if the conditions were cooler. the butterfly's can sometimes be in the sand and if they are lower in the sand they wont get as hot but  the higher up they are in the sand the hotter they will get and might form faster. if they are i sand they can change all kinds of speeds but it can all depends on where they are in the sand.
0	I think its false because if stage 3 froze than i will take more time to unfree.
0	The temperature of the sand shouldn't affect the eggs because when you look at your data table you can see there is no clear pattern for the temperatures to prove that there is a way for the temperature to affect whether leatherback eggs are hatch as male or female.
0	I think it is true because if it is cold it is harder for them to turn into a butterfly because it is so cold outside. Another example is if it is really hot outside then it would be hard for the crystal to change because it is so hot.
0	a male was born i 86.54 temp
0	I think this is true because the temperature can effect how the butterfly can grow, also how fast it grows.
0	because some eggs need to be incubated and stuff and some dot so maybe the sand can cause it to not you hatch it can take longer
0	Because it takes time for it to go through the stages. The temperature could change it maybe a little bit but not a lot for it to change how quick the stages go by.
0	Different butterflies are at different stages and the temperature  has nothing to do with how fast the butterfly goes through the stages of its life.
0	I think it is true because if this butterfly went some where really cold then i think it would affect how quickly it goes through their stages.
1	My claim is that the temperature that a chrysalis is in depends on how fast it grows into an adult because, if the temperature is 50 that is not normal for a butterfly to grow in the average temperature is around 60 degrees Fahrenheit. So if it was 50 degrees it would be below what they are used to so it would grow slower.
1	The reason why is because the 8th sample was at Playa it was 80.67 degrees and it was a male and the 9th sample it was at the same place and the temperature was 84.20 and it was a female. So the warmer it is it is a female the colder it is it is a male. Every temperature that is over 84 degrees is a female every temperature that is under 84 degrees is a male.
1	Yes this is true because I sorted the temps from low to high, and on average the lower temps were all male hatching. and the high temps were all female, so yes there is a correlation between sand temperature and the the gender of the eggs of leatherback turtles.
0	its false because we don't have enough information.
1	The lower temperature they are in the caterpillar stage and in the higher temperature they are in a chrysalis stage.
0	it take about a were
0	Sample 1 & Sample 2 were about the same temp but were Male and Female.But in Sample 23 & 24 the temp was 4 degrees different,but were also Male and Female.
1	i think it is  true because in this story it said it was faster when it was warm and not when it was cold
1	If a monarch butter was in a cold temperature area it would take longer because its to cold but if it was really warm the process would go quicker.
0	It's false because if you look at the data, there are still some caterpillars that have the same temperature as the ones in the chrysalis's. That means they are in the same temperature as the ones who are growing up faster.
0	I think it is true because if it hurting the eggs then it will start to hurt the baby turtle inside and that means there might not be anymore turtles after this!
1	As I quickly looked through the location, and went onto temperature where I looked and saw that mainly the monarch butterfly does turn into the chrysalis quicker at hotter temperatures whether inside or outside.
1	The caterpillars all went into their pups when the temperature was 59 degrees (F) or higher.
1	Some males where  born in hot texture same as females. It goes back and forth to say the heat affects the gender, if you say that  the hotter sand has females you would problem wrong  next time some males where born in high texture  thats why its problem false.
0	i think its false because it said that they hatch in the sand and go find safety in the sea they don't  say anything about having a special feature.
1	because at temperatures higher than 60 the caterpillar would be in a chrysalis and any lower it was still a caterpillar.
0	I think that the temperature faces the cycle us of the  temp difference of the caterpillar and the chrysalis
1	After 11 days there were more chrysalises when it was warmer and more caterpillars as it got colder. So warmer temps make the monarch butterfly's life cycle go faster.
1	I think the sand temperature affects whether leatherback eggs hatch as a male or a female. I think that because on the data the warmest sand had mostly females and the cooler the sand got the more males there was. The warmest sand a male was hatched in was 85.19. The coolest a female egg hatched was 84.20. That is why sand temperature affects whether leatherback eggs are female or male.
0	I looked at the chart and saw a female and male turtle that live in different places but same temputure
1	I think the claim is true because the graph shows that the highest temperature shows that the catupiler is in its chrysalis the coldest temperature the butterfly was still a catipiller.
1	I found that the butterflies grow more in warmer weather.   The butterflies in 54 degrees were still in the caterpillar stage.  But in the 62 degree range they were in the chrysalis stage.  That shows they grew more.
1	One reason why I think that is partly true partly false is if that were true then either 1 or 25 would NOT be the same gender as they are because number 1 (85.80) is only .61 hotter than 25 (85.19). I think it is partly true to because the the data shows Females average 85 and a half maybe more and also shows the Males average 84 and a half so that is why I think that it is partly true and partly false.
1	I think this claim is false because if you see on the data when monarch butterfly's  are inside they can be a caterpillar or a chrysalis. But on the outside it shows that it can be the same as the indoor. Also as you can see lower temperatures and higher temperatures can both be caterpillars or chrysalis's. So I don't believe the temperature affects them or the habitat.
1	I think it is partly true party false. If you look at the claim it is (the sand temperature affects weather leatherback eggs hatch as male or female.) Then look at the chart male temperature is from 85.19 to 80.60. Then look at female the temperature is from 88.8 to 84.20 so to me it looks like that if there is a higher temperature then there is a female and a lower temperature for a male. But I only think it is partly true partly false because the temperatures 84 and 85 are both in range for them both.
1	I believe that the sand temperature affects whether leatherback eggs hatch as male or female and here's why. because the lower 80s are mostly male the middle temp. 80s are a good mix, and the high 80s are mostly female.
1	I think that claim 1 is true because when the sand gets hot its most likely that a female will hatch. So when it gets colder some of the males will be born so what I am saying is whenever the sand gets hot a female comes out. Whenever the sand is cold and warm a male will come out.
1	I think it's partly true/partly false because from the data outside is kind of warmer then inside and in the higher temperatures the monarchs are already at the chrysalis stage. In the article it said that monarchs move to warmer places in the winter. Places that are not to cold and not to warm. But I also think it is partly false too because looking at the data some monarchs that are inside are in chrysalis.
1	The higher temperature are mostly female and the lower temperature are mostly male. I said partly true partly false because some male sea turtles are high temperatures and some female sea turtles are in the lower temperatures.
1	The higher the temperature is the higher the chance it's going to be a female. The lower the temperature is the higher  chance it has to be a Male leatherback.
0	I think the first claim is partly right and partly wrong because if you look at the data close enough you will see that the highest temperature is 63.14 and the life cycle stage is a chrysalis and as the temperature goes down you see that the life cycle stage has changed into a caterpillar so the life cycle of stage of the butterflies is taking a bit longer.
0	when i sorted the temperatures from lowest to highest it the males and females were mixed up. so i think that this would be partly true partly false
1	In the data shown in the picture it looks like the lower the temperature the slower the life cycle is.The data also shows the higher the temperature the faster the life cycle is.
0	I think that this is false because when you are a caterpillar you are not inside of you egg or chrysalis. And it says that when the caterpillar is in their chrysalis then are outside of their chrysalis. So like they are not even in it.
0	I think that it may be true because the highest temperature was a female and the lowest temperatures were all male. But i'm not positive all of the way because when the temperature got to around 84 degrees, it switched into like a pattern of male female male female female and then went onto the rest of the temps witch were only male.
1	I think this question is true because when the temperatures are getting warmer there are lots of chrysalis'. But when it is a little colder out there are mostly caterpillars.
0	                 *14/28 are female's in this graph.                        *14/28 are male's in this graph.                        which mean's...it is a 50/50                     chance it is a female and                   50/50 chance it is a male.           by suraiea smith
1	I think that the temperature affects the turtle eggs hatching male or female because as you can see on my graph, most of the lower temperatures are male, and the higher temperatures are female.
0	so the temp. helps but not to hot
0	how it migrated it changes treat the wind
0	there are no other reasons
0	I think this claim is false because the population has not stayed the same, this is because as the years increase the butterfly number increases to.for example in 1996 there were 33.50 million and fast forward to 2003 there were 556.00 and it just keeps dropping and soon there will be no butterflies.
0	Because I said so
0	I think the scientists are wrong the sands are not going down in temperature and the graph provides the evidence to support. Yes by the graph the sands go up and down every recorded time like it can go up then it can go down then back up then down but the last one is back up which supports my stupid claim
0	i think this because the temperature is going down and then going right back to the temperature it was at before.
0	because in 1960 the temperature was 84.56 in 1994 the temperature was 85.57 as so in 2016
1	Some are saying that the temperature of the sand in Rain Island, Australia has been decreasing since 1960. This information is incorrect. As I have made my graph of data that has been collected from the past years, I have found that the temperatures have gone up since 1960, not gone down.
0	I think it would be partly true and partly false because the temperature of the sand and rain   island , Australia UT In TxIN In PROBALEY WUL By RE
0	The number of butterfly have continuously been going up and down each year some dropping my the millions but the number is always changing each year making me say that this claim is false and that the number of butterflies has stayed the same each year. the lowest the butterfly population has been was in 2013 and the most is has been was in 1996 the numbers are way different than this author said.
1	I think that the temperature in the sand in Rain Island, Australia has NOT been decreasing since 1960, because in our data, the temperature is actually increasing instead of decreasing, for example in 1960, the temperature was 84.5 F, and in 2016, the temperature is up to 85.5.
0	i think it is true because it said people reached the butterfly so i think it is true if they said they reached the butterfly mexico it has to be in the right temperature not to warm or to cold.
1	in the year 2016 the temperature was higher than in 1960
1	when i shorter the years i  the new one is the hottest with 85.57 and the last is 84.56
0	all the temperatures are reasonably close to each other
0	I really don't know
0	Because mexico can not stay the same it have to change at some point that's what I think.
0	"I think that this is incorrect information because it states ""...the monarch butterfly population in mexico has stayed about the same.""However, as you see in my graph, through the years the population has gone anywhere from a bit less than 100 million to 900 million!Due to they scattering of the population I believe that in the past recorded years the population hasn\'t decreased, or increased. It has went back and forth, meaning that it is not only healthy, but that it is going on a natural in predictable course.So, in conclusion, claim #2 is completely incorrect."
1	i think it's false because it says they started tracking in 1993 and from 1993 to 2013 the population has gone down instead of staying the same it went from 909 million to 33 million.This is why i think that the monarch butterfly's population didn't stay the same.
0	Because more and more butterflies come there each year.
0	When the years went by the monarch butter flies population goes up little by little. so that means the population did not stay the same.
1	every year since 1996 the monarch butterfly population has gone down every time a new year comes so the butterfly population cannot be the same if in 1996 909.50 million butterflies and the in 2013 there are only 33.50 million they have gone down by about 878 million
0	because of their ar fewer turtles
1	the temp is increasing
0	because some places sand and stuff can be a different but id if has been changing
0	I think this is Partly True/Partly False because if you look at 1960 #24 the temperature is 84.56 F. Then in 1968 it decreases #14 to 83.75 F. So far its true but then in 1988 #5 it increases to 85.59 F and it really just keeps this process going over and over.
1	I do not think it has been decreasing because the graph shows otherwise. The data shows the sand going higher from year to year. In 1960 the temperature of the sand was 84.56, and in 2016 (most resent year on graph) the sand was 85.57. So it was not decreasing at all it was actually increasing.
1	The temperature was going up.
0	It is false because in 2002 it was 86.72 and in 2008 it was 15.21 but in 1964 it was 84.56
1	The claim is false because in 1996 their where 909.5 million butterfly's in Mexico. But in 2008 the butterfly population has gone down to 253 million and it decreased from there. Until 2013 where there was only 33.5 million butterfly's in Mexico so it is pretty obvious that the claim is false because the butterfly population went down 876 million in 17 years.
0	i think this claim is false because in the 1962 the temperature was 85.10 degrees and in 2012 was 85.06. the temperature has only dropped 0.6 degrees in 52 years.
0	The count in millions has changed a lot
0	true because everything ranges from 0 to 900
0	they lee for winter
0	So they don't over populate and have too much
1	In 1960 Temperature was 84.56 and in 2016 the Temperature was 85.57 so it increased.
0	when you look at the graph, you can see it stayed about the same, other than a sudden spike in 1995 and 1996.
0	throughout most of the early 2000 the count of butterflies stayed realitivly the same only changing slightly fro 200 million to 500 million
0	it is false because every year it is going up and up (the number in butterfly are increasing).
1	from different years it goes up and down but It seems that Its increasing than decreasing. In 2002 and up its going up in heat that getting colder in those years so I presently don't  think its decreasing I think its increasing.
1	yes because of its temporal is raising.
0	because it not changing
1	When you look at the chart pay attention to the numbers of the population. It was going downward! In 1993 the population was 3 million to 1996, 9 million now look at 2013, 33 million! It was in the hundred million not 10 million! You can not say it has stayed the same when it fell down to 10 million. I think the claim is False!
0	in 1960 it was 84.56 (f) then in 2016 it was 85.57 (f). that is why.
0	the monarch population staying the same is false because looking at my data, the numbers are nowhere near eachother
0	I think that because the temperature goes higher and lower at all different years. For example, in 1960 the temperature of the sand was 84.56 and in 1962 the temperature was 85.10 which is higher then before.
0	I think the claim is partly true because the temp. of the sand kind of went up and down.
0	
1	I think that the second claim is wrong because if you look at the chart close  enough you will see that the butterfly population is increasing in Mexico its not staying the same because if you at the chart under the word count the numbers show that the population is increasing not staying the same.
0	There is no pattern of the population, and the numbers deffenetly aren't the same.
0	it is going down then it goes up up up it decret ones then got even better
0	so they know what they are doing
0	global warming
0	it is true.
