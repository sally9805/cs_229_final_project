0	I think this clam is true, Because in the story it says the Monarch Butterfly's temperature affects how quickly it goes through its life cycle stages.
1	Most of the chrysalis temperatures are 60 degrees and over plus maybe the temperatures have something to do with their migration because the text did say that they premiered lukewarm temperature
0	I think it has to do with the turtle population.Because on top of the sand it was warm,But when you dig it gets colder because theirs no sun light but on the other hand when they get played the ones more to the surface they have more light then others and it shows what is the temperature with is just the right to hatch in my option but the ones with less heat still might hatch that why i think it is partly true/partly false
1	I think that this is true because mostly the females are born in hotter sands but all the temputaures are close together which would make me conclude that it would be true. Climate change might over populate the sea turtles because if more female are born in hotter sands that there is going to be a lot more female sea turtles to lay there eggs. This could also impact the population in a different way. That way being there would be not enough males so they could not mate. So that would make the population drop.
0	I think its true because in colder weather, monarch butterflies usually go inside where it warmer but when  monarch butterflies are in warmer weather they tend to go outside because it would be way warmer than the colder times.
0	i dont know add add add add and befriends are bryan tyler adds erin sabre will pickle spammy myself my sleep paralysis demand
0	The temperatures are not that different. They are all in the high 50s/low 60s. The majority is the caterpillar even though the temperatures at least 1 degree apart. But then again a few degrees can make a difference depending on the study.
0	i think it is true partly true and partly false because if they are in a really cold environment it probably would affect it when it comes out but it is partly not because when they are in the crystalline it can not affect them as much as when they come out
0	because the  evidence shows that the temperature is in the 80s so the sand has to be in the 80s to be hatched
0	the sands temperature in the ocean shore affects if  it will be a boy or a girl who will hatch from the   turtles egg.
0	i think it is false because under the sand the temp is the same even when it is colder above ground
0	because if it is cold the babies will die
0	i think that the statement was true because a butterfly cant be in the cold for as long as a caterpillar can because of the high winds and over the rain or snow coming down with all the hard pressure.
0	I think the claim is false because there were similar temples and it was out of order if it was male or female and in the wild scientists cant control the temper of the beach so why wouldn't there be more of one type of gender
0	butterfly's like the awareness but it does not help them grow does the awareness help us grow we like it like butterfly's it does not help us grow.
0	i think it is true because it said on one that it is a caterpillar and it was 56.84 (F) but then when it was in a scalar so the water songs all the time so the caterpillar is in all finds of whether.
1	True, because if the sand is cool then it is a male, but if the sand is hot then it is a female.
1	The females are usually hotter.
0	because some times its colder than other times and its still the same part of the cycle
1	I can see that the Female has bigger numbers then the Males
0	I think it is true because a turtle needs to feel comfortable when they are laying their eggs.
0	Cause the type of turtles only hatch as males
1	84.20 and up is almost all female
0	The data shows the caterpillars are turning into chrysalis at certain temperatures without supplying anymore info. How much did they eat? What did they eat? Where did they live? When did they eat? Were they sick? There's a lot more that we would need to know in order to tell. There are indoor caterpillars that turned in to chrysalis, but outdoor caterpillars, too. For all we know, the outdoor ones could be more productive out in the wild, and the indoor ones may just be fed and lazy.
0	I think its partly true and partly false Because, it depends where they are like if there  Africa i could be jest right or too hot or in Maine it could be to cold that's why they go away for the winter. They go the warmer limits when there limit is too cold. That's why I think its partly true and partly false.
0	because the male turtles have to stay safe and if we are being honest i don't remember the question
1	when it was cold outside they were mostly still caterpillars. I also saw that some of them were inside witch I think has effected how they grew to be butterflies because it was warmer inside then outside some days,  I think that may of effected how they grew.
1	because when in the higher temperatures the insect is mostly in the caterpillar stage and when it's in the lower temp they're mostly in the chrysalis stage but in some parts of the table that is not true.
0	I think it is false because the turtle born in Playa for example is a female that was born at a temperature of 85.80 degrees Fahrenheit and one of the males born in Playa is 84.98. There is also males, and females born in Surname that are almost exactly the same temperature when they were born. In conclusion that is why i think that The sand temperature doesn't affect whether leatherback eggs hatch as a male or female.   p
0	The thing I just read said that the eggs can change but nothing about weather effects the turtle eggs.
0	I think this is true because the temperature can effect how the butterfly can grow, also how fast it grows.
0	if the sand is hot it will effect the eggs
0	Claim: My claim is that the temperature of the sea turtles eggs doesnt affect the gender. Evidence: In the data it doesn't neccarsily show weather or not the it makes a different of the gender on the types of sea turtles. For example the lowest temperature. The highest temperature is 88.8 which is a female. The lowest temperature is 80.60 which is a male. Also in the data all the temperatures are mixed around it doesnt show anything like females are always hotter and males are colder and vice versa.Reasoning: That is the reasoning why i do not think that the temperature of the egg in the sand does not impact the gender of the sea turtle.
1	The temperature was higher for females.
0	I think it is true because if this butterfly went some where really cold then i think it would affect how quickly it goes through their stages.
1	I think the sand temperature does affect whether the turtle is male or female according to the data chart any temperature under 85 degrees the egg hatches and it's a male any temperature above 85 when the egg hatches it's a female.
0	because there all in the 80 to 85 temperature so it cant be because of the temperature. Some of them are almost the same temperatures but there different genders.
1	The reason why is because the 8th sample was at Playa it was 80.67 degrees and it was a male and the 9th sample it was at the same place and the temperature was 84.20 and it was a female. So the warmer it is it is a female the colder it is it is a male. Every temperature that is over 84 degrees is a female every temperature that is under 84 degrees is a male.
1	I believe that the female are born in the higher temperature than the males. The numbers on the board for females the highest is 87.09 for for the temp, but for the boys it's like 83.62 for the temp.
0	because sea turtles are diving we got to say those sea turtles
0	No because there are all different types of textures and they are both female and male so this claim is false. They all are 80 degree or over.
0	I think the turtles are letter back because there are different to other  times of anamules
1	there are more female in the higher temp and the males are in the lower temp and they kind of mix in the middle
0	I think this is true because if you read 20 you can see why I think it is the right answer.
0	there wore more boys than girls but  they were pretty close the same amount so that's why I said it was partly true and partly false
1	wel the data proves the fact true in the evidence because the higher temp the life cycle proceeded quicker
1	because at temperatures higher than 60 the caterpillar would be in a chrysalis and any lower it was still a caterpillar.
0	it keeps the eggs warm
0	Partly false because I assorted the data table by temperature and some temperatures were the same but they had a different gender. Partly true because from 80-84 they were mostly only male turtles and just a few female turtles. Through 85-88 there was only female turtles.
1	I think the sand temperature affects whether leatherback eggs hatch as a male or a female. I think that because on the data the warmest sand had mostly females and the cooler the sand got the more males there was. The warmest sand a male was hatched in was 85.19. The coolest a female egg hatched was 84.20. That is why sand temperature affects whether leatherback eggs are female or male.
0	I looked at the chart and saw a female and male turtle that live in different places but same temputure
1	The data shows that in higher temperatures females are normally hatched.  In lower temperatures male are normally hatched.
0	so on my chart i changed it to temp and it shows the colder it is the more likely to become a Caterpillar faster then the hotter places in the hotter places they are still in there chrysalis so it does affect how fast it goes through the life cycle and if i were a butterfly i would want to live in a colder place because i'm impatient.
1	I think the claim is true because in the information I recently got almost all the lowest are outside of the chrysalis and some off the highest are still inside of the chrysalis so my point is that the higher the temperature the longer your in the chrysalis.
1	The higher the temperature is the higher the chance it's going to be a female. The lower the temperature is the higher  chance it has to be a Male leatherback.
0	I think the first claim is partly right and partly wrong because if you look at the data close enough you will see that the highest temperature is 63.14 and the life cycle stage is a chrysalis and as the temperature goes down you see that the life cycle stage has changed into a caterpillar so the life cycle of stage of the butterflies is taking a bit longer.
1	I think that wen the sand is former the letter back trials are more likely to be female because the chart shows that in former teachers the portals are female
1	up high has mostly chrysalis and down below is all catapilar starting at sample number 3, inside, 59.36 degrees. however there are a few catapilars up above too.
0	when i sorted the temperatures from lowest to highest it the males and females were mixed up. so i think that this would be partly true partly false
1	I think this is partly true and partly false because their is one section where the graph doesn't support the claim of sand temperature affecting the gender. The graph also shows that the claim cant be fully false.
0	because I said so
0	i think that this is false because when the textures are higher it take longer and most people would think that it would go faster because there is more food.
0	                 *14/28 are female's in this graph.                        *14/28 are male's in this graph.                        which mean's...it is a 50/50                     chance it is a female and                   50/50 chance it is a male.           by suraiea smith
0	it is browed the same temp
0	because they just don't just lay girl turtle
0	there are no other reasons
0	"I think this is true because in the winter time when they go to liberate I think that most of all butterfly""s go to mexico because it is the most right temperature for the butterfly\'s to stay at mexico longer in the winter."
0	This is true because

0	i think this claim is false because, you can see in  1996 there were 909.50 monarch butterfly a year. now in 2013 there are only 33.50 that is a big difference. its because of the weather and global warming. that is why i think that claim is false. i am not saying they are  wrong but i am giving my thoughts and telling them why i think that.
0	it is partly true and partly false because it has gone up and done in the different years it has changed over all the years it has gone up and down
1	This thought is partly true/partly false because the sand in the 1960's through the 1982's these years had the lowest temps in theses years all the other years above that mostly are higher numbers
0	the change in weather can happen
0	I think is's false from 1996 the was 909.50 million butterflies going to Mexico compared 2018 with 302.50 million to 2013 with only 33.50
0	False because on the graph the numbers change depending on the years. because 1996 the butterfly rate was really hi and in 2013 it was really low.
1	well in 1960 the temp was 84.56 and in 2016 the temp was 85.16 witch is higher but the temp did drop some years but it has clearly gone up
0	the temperature of  the sand in rain island,Australia has been  decreasing since 1960.
1	I think it is false because if you look at the temperature in 1960 it is lower than in 2016, so than means that the temperature is not decreasing, that means that the temperature is increasing from 1960 to 2016.
1	i think it false because of limit chang it get hotel and hotel.
1	I think this statement is false because butterflies dies in a quick amount of time they don't stay around for 17 years and the data on the chart has different numbers leading up to 2013 as you can see it has gone down.
0	I think that this claim is false because when i was looking at the data for butterfly population I lined up the years from least to greatest and i started at the year 1993 because that's when scientists started keeping track of the monarch butterfly population and i saw that it kept on climbing up and the population started getting bigger and bigger.
1	I think that the temperature in the sand in Rain Island, Australia has NOT been decreasing since 1960, because in our data, the temperature is actually increasing instead of decreasing, for example in 1960, the temperature was 84.5 F, and in 2016, the temperature is up to 85.5.
0	ID
0	I think it's true because from 1994 to 2006 there has been about ten more or less than the year before and/or the year after that.
0	In 1993, when scientists started keeping track, there where 311.50 million Monarchs, but in 2018 there were 302.50 million Monarchs.
0	?
0	Because mexico can not stay the same it have to change at some point that's what I think.
0	Yes, because if you look at the temperature it is going down and down more.
0	I dont know
0	because it went from 33.50 to 909.50.
1	In 1960 the temperature was 84.56 and the temperature kept getting higher not decreasing.
0	this is why i think that the answer is true because up in the right corner  it says that in mexico the population stayed about the same.
1	Because when You Look At Them It starts at 909.50 and goes all the way down to 33.50. So It Dropped Very Low When through the years.
0	When the years went by the monarch butter flies population goes up little by little. so that means the population did not stay the same.
0	I think it is not changing because they are all different and all over the place with the temperature
0	I don't think the temperature of the sand in Rain Island has been decreasing because in the data it shows that the sand temperature from 1960 all the way up to 2012 has been in a five degree radius from eachother.
0	The count of butterflies in mexico go down and up alot. This is due to the evidence on the chart. But mexico seems to have more butterflies in the late 90's. But in the closer years (like 2017 and 2016) they have a fair amount of monarch butterflies.
0	I think its partly true because some of the years the temperature is colder than the other years 2002 is warmer then 2008 and 2010 because they are colder then the later years.
0	I think that this is false because they say the population stays the same but it doesn't. The population is more scattered than same.
0	I think this claim is wrong because in 1993 the population of monarch butterflies were at 311.50 million. But by 2003, the population has risen to 556.00 million. And by 2018 it went back down to 302.50. This is why I think the claim is false.
0	Out of time
0	i think this claim is false because in the 1962 the temperature was 85.10 degrees and in 2012 was 85.06. the temperature has only dropped 0.6 degrees in 52 years.
0	because this is dumb and I don't want to do it, and so Im not going to try. and also the temperature is literally changed by 1 degree !!!!!!!!
0	It increases every year
0	they lee for winter
0	So they don't over populate and have too much
1	the temp has been rising instead of going down
0	this claim is false because in 1993 the count is about 311 million and in 2011 the count is about 144 million and that's a pretty big difference.
0	I think it is partly true partly false because some butter fly were made from the cocoon and sme had to die off so i dont know if it is true or false.
0	throughout most of the early 2000 the count of butterflies stayed realitivly the same only changing slightly fro 200 million to 500 million
0	it is false because every year it is going up and up (the number in butterfly are increasing).
0	the temp of the sand doesn't change
1	if you look at the chart you can see that over the years the population has slightly but steadily dropped like in 2013 there was 33.50 million monarchs but in 2014 there was 56.0.
0	I think this claim is partly true because mostly a lot of females make it to Mexico to lay eggs when they hatch the females die. That wouldn't make the population of butterflies be exactly the same. The females lay several eggs witch would make more not the same. It is almost rare for butterflies to make it back from Mexico because of the weather or they die in Mexico.
0	it has mostly changed
0	I think this claim is false because, when you look at the graph, the count is not the same, in the years. In 1997, this is the most of the butter fly had been there.(in Mexico.)
0	The claim is that temperature of the the sand in Rain has been decreasing since 1960. I think that it is sort of true, because the highest the highest temp. that the sand reached was 86.72. that was in 2002. the lowest temp. that the sand reached was 83.75, that was in 1968. so the sand has been getting to temps. in between both those numbers.
0	the monarch population staying the same is false because looking at my data, the numbers are nowhere near eachother
0	well back when they first started keeping track it was the highest number and it was still really high then it was all over the place so it wasn't the same or it would have roughly the same numbers by years but they are just all over the place so i think they are wrong.
0	I put every year in order and then looked at the count (millions). Then, I realized that there were numbers of all different places. Some were higher and some were lower. For example, in 2009, the amount was 96.00 and in 1996, the monarch count was 909.50.
1	I think it is false because the graph shows that it is increasing instead of decreasing.
0	I think this claim is false because there is a lot of variety each year. for example in 2009 there were 96 million butterflies and in 2010 there were 201 million butterflies.
0	I think the claim is partly true because the temp. of the sand kind of went up and down.
0	Each year there's a little bit of a difference and sometimes it stays the same. In 1993 when scientists started estimating butterfly population the population was about 311.50 and the lowest one was in 2013 and it was 33.50.
0	It is false because the sand temperature keeps on going to 84 to 85. It starts at 84 then went up to 85 in 2016 so it's going up and not down.
1	its false because the temperature did not go down it went up
1	I think that the teacher has been increasing over the years and with low 1 it shows that females thrive in womens so if it is increasing in tempicher then there will be more female then male and that is why that are in danger.
0	I know that this claim is false. I know this because the temperature is barley changing. Over all the temperature is increasing rather than decreasing. This claim is opposite from the truth.
0	In 1993 there was about 316 butterflies but in 2018 there was about 300 butterflies
0	I think that this is false because the scientists are saying that that the population of the butterflies has been about the same in Mexico for the years that they have been counting then. I think that that is false because each year you can see that the population has been going up by millions over these past years. If you look at the evidence you can see that the population has gone way up. {By a OT}
0	I think its false because the numbers go up and down and up down each year.
0	86.72 it hier than 85.21   86.72=2020 .     85.21=2008
0	I think its false because of global warming. Global warming would actually make the get go up.
