0	because
0	I think this is false because the count goes from like 90 to 400 to 30.  On the graph it goes from 50 to 200 to 900.  900 is the most.  If it stayed the same most of the data would be in a line.
0	it went from 33.50 to 909.50

0	I think this claim is partly true partly false because it has to be a certain temperature for a cryselis to form.
0	its partly true because sea turtles do lay there eggs in the sand its partly false because the sand temperature does not help the eggs hatch into a boy or a girl
0	The reason why I think it is false is because it can't be true.
0	when they keep tract of them they can see were they are Going
0	the article said so
0	I think that the temperature can affect how fast the butterfly goes through it's life cycles because you don't want the temperature to be too hot or too cold, so I think that the outside was perfect temperature because if it was too hot the butterfly would probably not be able to grow as fast but you would want kind of hot so a little hotter then warm. You don't really want it to be that cold for a butterfly because then it won't grow fast you barely want any cold.
0	3 males were born in very hot sand and 2 females were born in coldsand
0	Because more and more butterflies come there each year.
0	its false because we don't have enough information.
0	This answer is false because looking at the temperature range, it's staying in the same range from 1960 and up.
0	because if its to cold it might freeze, killing the butterfly, and if its to warm or hot it could die of exhaustion or it could over-heat causing the stages of a butterfly to slow down.
0	The numbers of the butterfly is not the same
0	i think the claim is false because the number of butter flies has changed
0	they won be dead of the temprchor.
0	I think is true its because the monarch butterflies like it warn in Mexico.
0	it is the same speed going throne life size.
0	hdjhvjusdnvh
0	because in the 1990s there was maybe half 84 and half 85 but in the 2000s it is  more 84 than 85 I sorted it by year so I could see the difference between years in order I just checked if it was not just the 2000s they were talking about but it did not matter.
0	because it said it in the reading
0	I think this clam is false, Because well I was reading it said that we have to keep estimating the range, Because more Monarch Butterfly's keep coming to the perfect whether in Mexico to the forest.
0	it goes up and down in the data.
0	in mexico the count of marnark butter fly stay the same because it is always worm there
0	fight
0	Sample 1 & Sample 2 were about the same temp but were Male and Female.But in Sample 23 & 24 the temp was 4 degrees different,but were also Male and Female.
0	all the temperatures are reasonably close to each other
0	I think this is Partly True/Partly False because if you look at 1960 #24 the temperature is 84.56 F. Then in 1968 it decreases #14 to 83.75 F. So far its true but then in 1988 #5 it increases to 85.59 F and it really just keeps this process going over and over.
0	I think its true because it depends on the weather.And if is hot or cold 
0	I know the claim is partly true and partly false. I know this because The hot sand produces females and cold sand produces male turtles. the partly part is because in the middle of the graph, it's a mix of male, and female babies. I sorted it this way because the question was on the temperature of sand.
0	It is true because the temp. is just like the other female temp. so that is why I think it is true.
0	I think this claim is false. I think that because it is all around the same number. I think that because in almost all the numbers are 85 degrees  for example 17 out of 29 are 85 degrees. Another reason I think this is because the temperature goes down by like 1 degree and then it goes back up. for example it goes down to 84 degrees and then goes back up to 85 degrees.in conclusion i think this claim is false
0	i dont know
0	because it starts from caterpillar to chrysalis, then it ends with a caterpillar not a butterfly.
0	i think it is true because it said people reached the butterfly so i think it is true if they said they reached the butterfly mexico it has to be in the right temperature not to warm or to cold.
0	The Heights of sand go up and down through the years
0	The temperature of the sand shouldn't affect the eggs because when you look at your data table you can see there is no clear pattern for the temperatures to prove that there is a way for the temperature to affect whether leatherback eggs are hatch as male or female.
0	I think this claim is false because as you can tell with the years sorted in this order, you can see how the temperatures go up, down, up, down.  I notes that toward the end in the parts the temp raised! I think it's safe to say this claim is false. on the chart, the green circle represents the temp dropping and the blue circle represents the temp rising. these are just two examples of this.
0	Because if its cold the monarch will die because it does not have much fat on it so if will freeze to death
0	lb
0	because there are no data that the monarch butterfly has stayed in one place for many times in a row. it did not come back in 2013 but they did come back in 2014. so it is false they did not stay in on place for a while
0	i dont know
0	The reason i said it was partly true was because 2006 2005 2007 where about the same but years like 2018 2017 are not the same at all.
0	They when to know how the left skole goes so they keep track of the butterfly.
0	i think true because in australia they have rain and sun some times and i think that would affect them in australia
0	I think the numbers change depending like how much food threat or the temperature or the breeding.
0	the temperature does affect the life cycle of butterflies according to the evidence on the table.
0	I think it is true because if it is cold it is harder for them to turn into a butterfly because it is so cold outside. Another example is if it is really hot outside then it would be hard for the crystal to change because it is so hot.
0	The reason why is because heat can change how will it goes thought it's cycle because it can shell up and it could die in the cold due to the texture drop.
0	I think it is not engine because it do not say that it is
0	The number of butterfly have continuously been going up and down each year some dropping my the millions but the number is always changing each year making me say that this claim is false and that the number of butterflies has stayed the same each year. the lowest the butterfly population has been was in 2013 and the most is has been was in 1996 the numbers are way different than this author said.
0	It goes down and goes up
0	If you look at the data you will see the data I highlighted their is a Temperature the same and they are Male and Female.
0	Beaches the heat does not damage it but it could
0	I said it is false because when I looked at the data as the year went higher the temperature moving up. For example, in 1960 the temperature was 84 degrees and in 2014 it was 86 degrees.
0	The claim is false because one Monarch it grew up at 59.54 degrees, and it is in the 3rd stage of growing which is the chrysalis. While a Monarch who grew up in warmer temps at 63.14 degrees is at the same step in there life cycle the chrysalis. And that is why this claim is false
0	you got to save the travel
0	dot no
0	I think false because I assorted the data table by lowest to highest year and from 1960-2016 the range in temperature stayed within  83-86 it could not be decreasing.
0	a male was born i 86.54 temp
0	Because it takes time for it to go through the stages. The temperature could change it maybe a little bit but not a lot for it to change how quick the stages go by.
0	because all the year I saw were all different yes. but, one of the things it showed that in 2002 86.72 for the heat in ('F). it shows that in 1994 in was 85.57  for the heat in ('F.
0	In 2013, the population was 33.50 million, but in 1998, it was almost 30 times that! Not much more to say.
0	i think its true because the temperature affects whether leatherback eggs hack then they will die
0	the reason i think this is false is because marco that not manager come to  main
0	On the chart after 1960 it sometimes get higher and sometimes lower.
0	I think its true because in the important data its says the temperature can change if its a girl or boy
0	this is boring
0	It was warm and it grew and it was cold and it grew the same time.
0	because it says that on the recording page and every year it gets lower
0	I really don't know
0	in 2018 there was 302 and in 1995 there where 630 and in 1996 there was 909 and in 2013 there was 33 so I think that that claim is false.
0	when I sorted the temperatures from lowest to highest the highest temperature was in 2002 so i do not think they have been going down since 1960
0	no because it goes from 85.21 to 86.72 also it keeps going from 84 to 85.
0	i don't know you tell me
0	It is true because from 1993 to 2018 it has stayed very close .The count is off by 9.00 million monarch butterflies.
0	As seen in the chart sample one is shown the highest. If you look underneath it you can see sample number 27 and 26. This shows that the climate of the island has not changed very much. Yes, the last test is showed low but most of the other tests show high temperatures.
0	The years are going up and the temperature is not getting warmer or colder it is staying in the 83.0-87.0 range
0	i think that it is party true and partly false. i think this because even though it is about the same  doesn't mean that it did not drop before.
0	I think it is true because if it hurting the eggs then it will start to hurt the baby turtle inside and that means there might not be anymore turtles after this!
0	I think that the temperature effects how quickly it goes threw its life cycle stages partly true/partly false. Because when it is inside it has no place to do its stages and its temperature is to high or low. Also, It is different when its a chrysalis because, whether inside or outside its about the same temperature either way.
0	i dont know
0	I think its partly true and partly false because some of the male and females have almost the same exact temperature and some of them have lower or higher temperatures so it can be either gender depending on the goodness or the warmth of the sand or the eggs.
0	The number (in millions) goes up every year. that is NOT staying at around the same number.
0	I think its only Party True / Partly False. I think this because if you look at the data you will see mainly in one locations its true about the claim but once you look at both you see that it's its not all true. Because for example #28 and #2 Work then if you look at another pair such as #22 and #26 it doesn't work in the slightest if you compare with the first example.
0	if it was cold it probably not hatch
0	sometimes it did turn into a chrysalis, and sometimes it didn't. Iv'e heard that it depends how much food it has.
0	Because the numbers on the chart.
0	well some years it was decreasing and some years it was getting hotter so i dont know if thats a true fact that ever since 1960 the sand temp has been decreasing
0	Because the temperature has been going up and down since 1960-2016.
0	I don't think it really matters were they are born or what temp it is they will be any gender really think surname has more boys than girl and playa has more girls than boys.
0	because they go to mexico in winter
0	it is very important to know understand protect these beautiful  animals
0	the global warming is affecting the sand which makes it to hot
0	because of their ar fewer turtles
0	The weather is not going down. I know that because in 2002 it was just about the same temperature as it was in 2012.
0	in 1960 it was 84.56 (f) then in 2016 it was 85.57 (f). that is why.
0	I thinks it is true because a Leather back  can have male or female. some male and female have temper in there body that makes it feel warm or cold.
0	because very one of them are different numbers
0	i think it is false because the sand cant get colder only the water can
0	I think this is partly true and partly false because, when I sorted the data lowest temperature to highest, the lowest temperatures had mostly caterpillars. When I looked at the higher temperatures it had mostly chrysalises.There were still a few caterpillars in the high temperatures so I think this fact is partly true,partly false
0	The temperatures have not been decreasing they have been staying around 85 degrees the coldest its been there is 84 degrees.
0	on the chart it shows that the temperature has decreased and in crested over time making this evidence true
0	how it migrated it changes treat the wind
0	I think this because some years there very little and some years there was a lot.
0	because in 1996 there was 909 and a half million and in 2013 there is only 33 and a half million
0	it will stay the same because it is warm all year around
0	it might of been decreasing because of the weather
0	Usually, a caterpillar needs its time to hatch into a butterfly. That's whether try to find the best place in a warm and slightly cold place like California and Mexico. If you don't know. On Day 11 the Chrysalis did not hatch faster or slower. It usually stays outside more than inside
0	i think that if the temperature where to change the speed of the butterfly's growth then all the factors in the butterfly's life would change the speed of the butterfly growth and its life cycle i think maybe the winter could make them die so that why they go down to other areas such as Mexico and based on the data it says that the chrysalis was in 63 degree weather and that was the top degrees in this hole graph so that shows that the weather doesn't speed the life cycle of the monarch butterfly's.
0	I believe the claim is false because in my graph the temperature has shown increase from the year 1960.
0	I think its true because males and females are different just like a girl and boys are different and turtles need the right temperature to have baby turtles yes playa and surname is a place that I dont know it is very warm 80 degree of the sand is very warm for baby turtles baby turtles need the same temperature same of the two places have different temps turtles are baby the sand might be too hot or too cold turtles need the right place the also need the weather to be warm to go in the cold water because the water will be even more cold if there is not sun the water will be warm
0	the numbers ether drop or raise depending on the year
0	Because the temperature is higher.
0	Because it is not straight line.
0	The temp goes up by a degree and then one year it will go down by a degree.
0	It is true because when I put the years from lowest to highest so that is why I think it is true.
0	I think that is partly true and partly false because overtime in 1960 the temperature was 84 degrees it did get hotter but it did call down sometime but gobble warming witch is making the weather warmer also it goes down and up so i guess it is kind of the same
0	because some butterfly's moved to other places in the world they did not just stay in one place.
0	I think it is because if its cold the butterfly might freeze and if they are warm they will have a longer lifespan and they migrate so if the to some place warm and the temperature changes they might die
0	it is going down then it goes up up up it decret ones then got even better
0	I think that the  sand tempechure WNT change whether  a sea turtle caches a boy or girl. Because i looked at the data table and saw that mostly  regardless of the  temechure ita an even chance.
0	Because it is true
0	I think that the sand temperature in Rain Island has not been decreasing since 1960 because the temperature numbers have just kind of been scattered around after I organized the data by year.
0	it dose not mater.
0	I think its false because male and female turtles were being born in 85 degrees.The same goes for 84 degrees.
0	Because when it's a girl the temperature is in the 80's and when its a boy the temperature is in the 80's too.
0	because more butterfly's have grown sense 1993 so the population has grown and grown sense then
0	I know why it would be true, because Where it says claim two,  it says that its decreasing.
0	Because the lowest amount of butterflies was in 2013 and their was 33.50 . In the middle is 2008 and their was 253.00. then the largest amount was in 1996 and their was 909.50 butterflies!
0	In my graph, the dots representing the number of butterflies are scattered all over the place, definitely not the same. This proves that the claim is false.
0	I think that this is partly true because at  first it is a egg and then it goes into the caterpillar for a long time then it will go into the chrysalis then the last thing of its cycle is it goes into the butterfly and then it will go to its place to migrate but the place will not be to cold or it will not be to worm  it will  be just right for the butterfly to live in the winter time.
0	I think this is false because number 27 is 2014 and 86 degrees and then we look at 1990 its also 86 degrees and then in 2016 its 85 degrees
0	I think that this is false because when you are a caterpillar you are not inside of you egg or chrysalis. And it says that when the caterpillar is in their chrysalis then are outside of their chrysalis. So like they are not even in it.
0	The Sea turtles, male or female, are born at a temperature of 80 to 90 degrees F.
0	no they are not because other monarch butterfly are migrating there.
0	i'm not good with math
0	I think its False because its not the first one to be the lowest number
0	because i feel like it is true and
0	When I sorted the graph by year, I realized that is g from 33.50 to 302.50!!! i think that the population of butter flies is just rising and falling. If the population is about the same how did it go from 33.50 to 302.50 in five years?! I completely disagree with the statement about the population.
0	the tempocher stead the same
0	every time in two years the temperature was in between 84-86
0	in 2013 there were 33.50 million and in 1996 there was 909.50 million and that is an 876 million difference.
0	the population has moved around a lot because it has gone all the way from 33.50 to 909.50 and that is a big difference.
0	If it stayed about the same it would have been in the 30s but now it went from thirty three to 56.50 within a year.
0	because the butterfly make hundreds of more butterfly
0	australias nesting area is the most important nesting area so it cant be decreasing
0	The temperature of the sand in Rain Island, Australia has been decreasing since 1960.
0	I think it's false because in the data It looks like the population for monarch in Mexico is decreasing. In 1993 the population of monarch in Mexico was 311.50. I think it was increasing and now it is decreasing. The highest year on the data chart is 2017 the population is 124.00 in 2017.
0	I think that it's false, because there most likely  be a way for the sand does the turtles gender's.
0	it does not ladder about the weather. It just ladders what the turtle gave birth to in the eggs.
0	if the caterpillar is in the cold weather mean it is in a chrysalis it would slow it down the save its energy.
0	i think this because the temperature is going down and then going right back to the temperature it was at before.
0	its more worm down in mexico
0	because if the temperature change  will efeckit and it will not think it is clam.
0	latherback sea turtles are the biggest species. and they can get up to 2000 pounds but the green sea turtle can get up to 500 pounds an live up to 100 years old
0	BASE In HOMEAFOBIC AND I ATE TRANSEGENDER
0	It could be because of rain and the temp in the air around the sand that makes the sand colder. its defiant going down.
0	so they know what they are doing
0	yes because i looked at the map type thing and if i'm right it shows the population of the monarch butterfly.the map gives me a good way of seeing the population and im going with that the population is the same now than it was.
0	i think that it is ministre but false
0	The temperatures of a monarch butterfly's can affect the life cycle because for example, the intense heat may interfere with butterfly's natural habitat and life cycle changes and can put heat on monarch butterfly's life cycle by shutting down their organs, or maybe slowing down the process of growing.
0	because more monarch butterfly's are coming in to Mexico
0	so the temp. helps but not to hot
0	I believe that the temperature can maybe change if it is a male or female, but I don't really know.  Some of the results say record that there were 4 males or females in a row at the same place with there temperatures would be different in different places, but they also show in some sections that they can be scattered (one female one day a male a different day). But on the other hand, a female lays there eggs all together in the same place under the sand so the temperature would be very close in the same hole and there are different genders in one hole.  So I think that it can be true or false.
0	The report dos not say it decreases.
0	when you look at the graph, you can see it stayed about the same, other than a sudden spike in 1995 and 1996.
0	as you see the years to 1960 to 2016 the 1960 is at 84.56but the 2016 is at 85.57 so it is false
0	I think that the temperature faces the cycle us of the  temp difference of the caterpillar and the chrysalis
0	because mexico is a relay some stat. they wont be dead.
0	The sand temperature does not hove anything to do with if the leatherback being male or female.
0	The data shows that in 1996 the population of the Monarch butterfly was 909.50 and in 2013 the population is 33.50 which shows a gigantic difference through 1996-2013.
0	?
0	If you put the temperature from lowest to highest and look at the male/  female called, the low temperature is female, and the male is in the high temperature.
0	I think it would be partly true and partly false because the temperature of the sand and rain   island , Australia UT In TxIN In PROBALEY WUL By RE
0	because the temperature is the same all the time or in the same range or temp.
0	the temperature does not seem to affect the butterfly's life cycle.
0	I think it is partly true because butterfly can stay the same but not that long. I also know that mexico has alot of butterfly.
0	I believe that the claim is false because on the chart in 1960 the temp.was 84.56 and the other years have had a lower temp.And other years the temp. has been higher.
0	I think it's partly true because it shows that inside they are mostly still chrysalis and outside its more of caterpillars
0	Different butterflies are at different stages and the temperature  has nothing to do with how fast the butterfly goes through the stages of its life.
0	if you look at 1,2,and 3 the first is female and the temperature is at 85.80 and then the second one is male the temperature for that one is 85.04 but if you look at the third its female but the temperature is 84.77 which is colder than the males
0	i dont now
0	i think it is true because if there cocoon is frozen then they can't be changing and there stages of becoming a butterfly.That's why i think the temperature matters in a butterfly's habitat.
0	I think it's true because, I think that when it's hot the chrysalis is more likely to be wanting to get out of the chrysalis. The butter fly could also be wanting to dry it's wings on the sun ( because it's hot.)
0	because the butterfly has to go places
0	it has been decreasing but not very fast.
0	because for some reason the heat makes the gender different and the turtles know this so they place their eggs in different places accordingly.
0	because
0	The temperature changes the gender because when they are first laid they sea turtles are are not formed. The sea turtles are really unidentified
0	Because it shows inside and outside and two are both caterpillars but then also one is a chrysalis. That is the same tempachure so kinda true kinda false
0	It says the sand temperature affects whether leatherback eggs hatch as male or female, but scientists figure out when they hatched.
0	If you look at the chart the year 1960 is lowest but then it is increasing not decreasing so I think that claim 2 is false.
0	I think this claim is true because if the temp changes out side the sand changes.
0	its false because the count is going higher over the years.
0	it can tack longer for some butterfly's to go in to a chrysalis, then others.
0	Because you have to know the butterfly's temperature if you are going to learn about them
0	I think it is true because different habitats can have an effect on stuff like the food there. not the right food can affect its life stages life, for example, it could be late on becoming a butterfly or like it could be a caterpillar for longer than it should
0	maybe it is because of  partly true/ partly False
0	The temperature seems to go up and down each year. It isn't exactly decreasing, but it does go down a tiny bit each year. But then it will rise again, being back to the temperature it was before. I believe it's partly true, but the temperature rises again in a few years,
0	if you look at sample 6 in 1962 the temperature is at 85.10 but then if you look at sample 27 in 2014 its at 88.18
0	The answer to the question is false.  It is false because the information I am getting says that it has gone up a lot more.
0	Sea turtles are kinda the same as people. When they are born the heat doesn't change the gender. For ex: Sample number 3 and 16 They both have 84 as there temperature but one is female and one is male. It depends on if the father gave that egg the X or Y in the chromosomes.
0	because the sometimes they will momentarily leave the area
0	I think claim 2 is false because the population is going up a lot and is almost up to 1000 so i so not think claim 2 is telling the truth.
0	some caterpillar's and chrysalis live in the same location and some are growing faster than others
0	i thin that is true because that is wat the data said and thats the soul of life for a outer fly
0	i said no because it says on the top temperature 85.80 and its a female and on the 2nd one down is says 85.04 and its a male
0	The count in millions has changed a lot
0	they cep track of the butrflis and the polplashen it just fin and the botrflis are fin that do what the wont when ever that wont .
0	It is false because in 2002 it was 86.72 and in 2008 it was 15.21 but in 1964 it was 84.56
0	I think its false because every year its grows to more counts  but in the claim it said the populations stayed the same every year.
0	I think it doesn't mater
0	I believe that the sand temperature affects whether the leather back eggs hatch as a fem. or male.Because in the article it said that scientist sometimes collect the eggs and control the temp. and then check if they are a fem. or male.
0	because all female turtles lay their eggs on the beach and then she leaves them
0	I don't think that the temperature affects there gender because they were already made in the costume of the turtle. So if I was in my moms costume and it was hot I don't think that would affect my gender. But this is a hole different animal. But its not able to switch its gender.A mom cant just say i want a girl. that's not possible.
0	sample #7 is almost the exact same top as #60
0	The monarch butterfly stays in mexico because it likes the heat.
0	the go throw stages and the winter that are they miller mills from that nachrol habitat
0	I think this is true because the data table shows that the temperature was decreasing lower and lower each time they tested it.
0	it take about a were
0	The temperature has been mostly the same when you look at the data, so obviously, it wouldn't be decreasing over the years.
0	because ofclimat change
0	the temperature is always within 2 degrees
0	because each year more go to Mexico because it's warm in Mexico.
0	It's True because it is the same thing but their are a little difference. They almost have the same patterns.
0	In my graph since the year 1993 it has rapidly increased, rapidly decreased, and mediocrity decreased. Which is the exact opposite of the scientists claims.
0	i dont know
0	Because I said so
0	All of the facts that were included in this text had great details. I think temperature does effect how fast the monarchs go through their life cycle. I think this because if they get to cold when they are in their chrysalis they can freeze on the inside and not grow. Also, if it is too hot for the caterpillar in it's chrysalis it would probably kill them and cause them to not grow anymore.
0	I looked  at the smallest tempsort and it is 2002 With i found helpfullbeculs  In means it is NOT decreasing if 1960 is only 8456
0	If you look at number 26 the temperature is 63.14 and the butterfly is in its chrysalis but if you look at number 29 the butterfly is a caterpillar
0	because the numbers jump all over the place from high to low.So it seems like it doesnt matter what temperature it is
0	I think that it is true because they say every winter they migrate Mexico and they estimate the butterfly population every year sense 1993.
0	Female or Male they go to warm places where temperature go up to 80 degrees. They always go to warmer places
0	I think it is partly true/ partly false. I think this  if you look at the data, it will go back and fourth between chrysalis and caterpillar. Right in the middle of the data it goes back and fourth. there will sometimes be a caterpillar in the beginning. I believe that it could help to study the location of the butter fly. and if it is inside or outside a building/structure.
0	I think this is true because global warming could change the temperature of the sand.
0	I think that this claim is false because in the graph  made it shows that it did go down on the third year but then it started to increase sense then and it does not seem like it is going down any where.
0	because in the picture it was dawn and some time's its cold at night time
0	The temperatures
0	if its cold or if its a bigger egg it will hatch more slow if its a bigger or more cold cattipiler will stay in to keep worm
0	hi my name is ................
0	because some places sand and stuff can be a different but id if has been changing
0	yes because 50 50
0	I think when the caterpillar is outside it will get very warm and when the caterpillar is inside it will cool off.
0	I think the scientists are wrong the sands are not going down in temperature and the graph provides the evidence to support. Yes by the graph the sands go up and down every recorded time like it can go up then it can go down then back up then down but the last one is back up which supports my stupid claim
0	because if sea turtles don't have enough sand they can't buried there eggs and if they do predators will get to them.
0	because i was watching a lamar beam vid and he said titles are mostly laying eggs in kickoff middle temperature  but i believe hed tell us if they were laying eggs in warm whether or cold whether
0	This is shipping because of the forest fires and polotchiponthat has been happening for years
0	because some eggs need to be incubated and stuff and some dot so maybe the sand can cause it to not you hatch it can take longer
0	i picked partly true and party false because i feel like a butterfly starts asa caterpillar then grows to be a butterfly like other butterfly like ones we have in maine like the ones that come out in the summer and they have to have temperature thats not to hot or cold that is what i think\
0	I think That It's Partly true And Partly False Because When You Look At the chart it Kinda Changes The form By temperature But it Kinda Doesn't.
0	because it is warm water
0	I think that the population has gone up by so much it has gone up by like 800 million
0	
0	At 1998 first to number is getting lower just like what the claim #2 have say about that Rain Island, Australia, has been decreasing since 1960. but then the rest is the increasing then decreasing. I might actually not really know what their meanings are.
0	in 2008 the temperature is 85.21 but in 2002 the temperature is 86.72
0	i think this because everything is different and if it is true when its inside and 59 above it does seem a little true.
0	Since 1960 the temperature has bean in the 80's but it has bean going down but not by much at all
0	Most of the monarchs are still caterpillars because it takes a long time to create a chrysalis,and since it takes long to make a chrysalis it is partly true.But if we did the same but with only chrysalis we will see that its just in the middle.
0	because It's mostly the same temperature.
0	because it was in the reading!!!!!
0	ariana
0	I think this is false because in 1960 the temperature was 84.56 and the the temperature in 1962 was 85.10 so its been going up not down.
0	I think this because the graph didn't show anything about the turtle amount.
0	If the monarch butterfly goes through the stages fast then it's probably used to doing something fast and not having the patients to do stuff so that's probably one of it's habit
0	if you see the evidence you see that the first 2002 thing is 86.72 degrees but in the 2012 one it is 85.06
0	i think this claim is false because This table jumps from 556.00 million to 109.50 million
0	is all way hot on a land so they have t o adapt to the heat and there in the sand so the egg are kept cold
0	because the report show that the tempiture doesnt really matter
0	I believe this claim is false. I believe it to be false because in the graph you can clearly see there is nearly an equivalent amount of male and female leatherback hatching. In addition, they are hatched in the same temperature range of about 80 to 85 Fahrenheit.
0	As you can see the claim is false one of the female leatherbacks are 82.45 and it was at surname and a different leatherback was 86.97 and it was at surname so it is false
0	It's false because if you look at the data, there are still some caterpillars that have the same temperature as the ones in the chrysalis's. That means they are in the same temperature as the ones who are growing up faster.
0	if its to cold it will freeze to death and if its to warm its perfect temp for it to live
0	I think that  it is partly Files cup it lakes a long time to              become a butterfly..
0	vanessa
0	because when my uncle was in the coast caused  had to practice scuba diving and when he did did they boat like a almost 100 year old turtle in i think i said i think to do something with it he never told me what he did with the turtle
0	because in 1960 the sand temperature was 84.56 and in and in 1972 it was 84.20
0	The temperature has been increasing not decreasing. The graph helps me see that.
0	The graph shows that the temps of the sand have decrease but in some years they got higher.
0	This claim is false because there is barely a decline in temperature. If you were to say that there is a decline you would need to know it only drops down 1 degree every few years. In the graph, you can see that in 2000,1994, 1992, 1974, 1988, and 1962, it stays 85 degrees Fahrenheit.
0	Most eggs don't hatch with warm weather but they also can hatch themselves.
0	i think  it is false because they don't rush right throw  there life cycle
0	In the chart to the right in the outside with the crystals is almost the exact same outside with a caterpillar
0	Because I think that sand can not be wash away from the tech the humans
0	the
0	I think its wrong because there are similar temperatures and some die as a caterpillar and some die in a chrysalis. for example, there is one where it's 60.90 and it dies as a caterpillar then there's one where its 60.98 and it dies as a chrysalis.
0	because it will still be in the 50 or 60 degrees if it is outside or inside
0	ariana
0	If your looking at the chart, all the temperatures are around 83,85, and 84. Which means they haven't been decreasing at all.
0	In 1996 there were 909.50 mil butterflies. But in 2013 there were 33.50 mill and that is not a lot.
0	I believe that the temperature of the monarchs habitats does not depend on the monarchs habitat temperature. The reason that it doesn't depend on the  temperature is because the results vary between inside and outside of the temperature of the chrysalis. One of the temperature for the chrysalis is 59.54 Fahrenheit  and another is 63.14 Fahrenheit that is a 4 degree difference. Also the colder one is outside and  the hotter one is inside. That's why i Believe that the temperature does not matter for a monarch caterpillar to turn into a chrysalis.
0	i think its false because it said that they hatch in the sand and go find safety in the sea they don't  say anything about having a special feature.
0	Yes the temperature slowly defended from 86 degrees to 85 then to 84 then back up to 85. So in conclusion the temperature did go down by about a degree.
0	i think this is false because the evedace shows the number of butter go up
0	it is because the lay a baby every 1 month
0	"in 1996 the butterfly population in Mexico was 909.50 million. But scientists say that the population has always been about the same?! thats not possible. Because the earliest time they have so far is in 2018. and in 2018 there were only 302.50 million butterfly\'s. So i think the scientist who stated this is very off. 909.50 compared to 302.50 is a big difference, the butterfly population in Mexico has not ""stayed the same."""
0	global warming
0	I think its true because number 1 is 2002 its 86.72 and number 14 its 1968 its 83.75 its getting lower and I know Deccriceing means going down
0	Because as the data shows from 1996 to 2013 the number of butterfly has gone down a big number. So what clam two is saying is that the numbers has stay the same but looking at the data you can see that is not true.
0	i think that because they can both be man or female
0	because it not changing
0	because the heat goes but it also goes low
0	I think its false because if stage 3 froze than i will take more time to unfree.
0	if it did rain since 1960 the sand will be wet
0	I think this claim is true because in Playa the temperature is 85.80 and the turtle is a Female and in Playa the temperature is 80.67 and the turtle is a Male.
0	it is true.
0	I think this is true because if it is super cold outside the butter fly will be very cold and might freeze to death.  But if it is to hot the butter fly might die of heat.
0	It's not about the sand temperature it's about if their genes are stronger and their genes determine what gender they are.
0	When we look at the  year, then at the temperature, we can see that in 1960 the temperature was high, but it said that the temperature in Rain Island was decreasing, which means that it was going down.
0	I have made a chart so you can see that I am right because they stated.
0	i think that can not fly that fast to my great that are spostohibrnat in a con
0	because over the years the count of butterfly's in mexico had increased and decreased alot
0	I really don't know.
0	When I sorted the data by year(lowest to highest), I found that the amount has increased and then decreased through the years. It has not stay really stayed the same.
0	true because everything ranges from 0 to 900
0	i think it is partly true and partly false because the temperature is dropping down and rising back up from the 1960 to the 2016
0	They have not stayed the same since scientists started keeping track. They actually have decreased by over 300 million the first year and then over 20 million the last year
0	Yes it has because it's been at a constant migration of the protest of the change of the butterfly started at 2020 to 1996.
0	most shows that the top is different but they still grow the same
0	I think that it may be true because the highest temperature was a female and the lowest temperatures were all male. But i'm not positive all of the way because when the temperature got to around 84 degrees, it switched into like a pattern of male female male female female and then went onto the rest of the temps witch were only male.
0	it shows that really no matter what temp it is that any male or female can hatch
0	because in 1960 the temperature was 84.56 in 1994 the temperature was 85.57 as so in 2016
0	I dont know
0	i think its true because it said in the subtitle that this was true.
0	they went up 1 or 2 but some went down 1
0	you need to start at 1993 and count up till 2018
0	it changed a lot and they were in all kinds of places
0	There is no pattern of the population, and the numbers deffenetly aren't the same.
0	I think it is false because if an egg is laying playa sand it can come out as a female or male because if you look at the chart and look at what gender is next to playa sand it will say either female or male, not just male, not not just female. Same to do with the Surname sand.
0	vanessa
0	I think that because the temperature goes higher and lower at all different years. For example, in 1960 the temperature of the sand was 84.56 and in 1962 the temperature was 85.10 which is higher then before.
0	i dont now
0	because  the sand in the summer id most of the time on the top of the sand is hot but on the bottom, it is cool not super cold then     ? do they lay eggs in the winter
0	Looking at my data I decided that I would make it into a graph. Then I set the Y axis to sample number and X axis to year then I added a trend line and saw the data going down hugely. It went from 909.50 to 33.50.
0	it is false because i 1960 it was 84.56 degrees, and in 1962 it was 85.10 degrees, so it is not decreasing.
0	I think this is false because they are all different temperatures and one of the males temperature is 84.98 and a females is 84.20 so those are almost the same temperature so it does not matter.
0	if anything there over populated
0	"I think that this is incorrect information because it states ""...the monarch butterfly population in mexico has stayed about the same.""However, as you see in my graph, through the years the population has gone anywhere from a bit less than 100 million to 900 million!Due to they scattering of the population I believe that in the past recorded years the population hasn\'t decreased, or increased. It has went back and forth, meaning that it is not only healthy, but that it is going on a natural in predictable course.So, in conclusion, claim #2 is completely incorrect."
0	I think this claim is false because the population has not stayed the same, this is because as the years increase the butterfly number increases to.for example in 1996 there were 33.50 million and fast forward to 2003 there were 556.00 and it just keeps dropping and soon there will be no butterflies.
0	I think this claim is true because if its cold the butterflies are gonna want to be in their Chrysalis. Like when you are cold you wouldn't want to be outside in the cold you want to be raped up in your blanket cause its warmer.
0	in 2016 it was only 85.57 and that isn't too far from 1962 and that was only 85.10 there is only 47-degree difference
0	It has not been decreasing because it got higher.
0	I think it is kinda true that the population has stayed the same because in the summer i haven't seen alot of them but, their could be alot and i just don't see them so i think it is kinda true and kinda not true.
0	the important info says the tempecher effects the gender.  its right because with my evidence it effects the turtles by gender.it also says that the temp effects the turtles in the story.s
0	In 1996 909.50M butterflies were in Mexico but in 2013 only 33.50 butterflies were in Mexico that is a big difference so it has not stayed about the same.
0	I think this claim is true because the butterfly can't be in the cold or high winds unlike a caterpillar that stays on the ground.
0	sometimes it might be harder to lay eggs and give birth in colder-weather because it might hurt
0	think that the temper dose not matter as long as the butter file can survive.
0	I think it's partly true and partly false because there are some caterpillars that have not became a chrysalis in the same temperature as the caterpillars that have already became chrysalis.
