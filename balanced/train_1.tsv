1	The table shows that lower temperatures are males and higher temperatures are female
1	Yes this is true because I sorted the temps from low to high, and on average the lower temps were all male hatching. and the high temps were all female, so yes there is a correlation between sand temperature and the the gender of the eggs of leatherback turtles.
1	sometimes the female leatherbacks are born around 84 degrees to 87 degrees.
1	In the data if we take the oldest date and the newest date, we will see that the water is accutaully is increasing.
1	"For the first 2 data reports, both ""butterflies"" were outside. 2\'s butterfly was outside in warmer weather, and was a chrysalis already. 1\'s butterfly\'s was in a cooler weather than 2 so warmer weather does speed up the life cycle of a butterfly."
1	I think it is false. So look at the chart at 1960 the temperature is 84.56 but almost every year after that it has been 85 or 86 but some have been 84 but most are higher on 84. But on 1964,1970 and 1972 are all lower but it said that it has been decreasing since 1960 which means every year after that but way more are higher plus the last year is 85.57 which is also higher.
1	I think this claim is true because, when I organized the data by temperature, I saw some patterns. First, when the eggs were in the 54 - 59.36 degree range, they were all caterpillars. Second, when the eggs were in the 59.37 - 60.90 degree range, they were a mixture of caterpillars and chrysalises. Lastly, when the eggs were in the 60.91 - 64 degree range, they were all chrysalises. That is why I think the claim is true. The temperature of a monarch butterfly's habitat does affect how quickly it goes through its life cycle stages.
1	The sand temperature affects whether leather-back eggs hatch as male or female because scientific research proves that when the eggs have been laid in warmer sand, the turtle is a female. When the egg is laid in cooler sand, the turtle is a male. Also, These turtles have been laid in different locations. So we know that in Playa the turtles don't tend to be female. That part is totally random. The Male and Female's were both scattered around Playa and Surname.
1	the temp is increasing
1	I found that the butterflies grow more in warmer weather.   The butterflies in 54 degrees were still in the caterpillar stage.  But in the 62 degree range they were in the chrysalis stage.  That shows they grew more.
1	females only hatch above 85 degrees and males hatch at 85 degrees and lower
1	I think it is true because in the data the lower temperature the more males and the higher temperature the more females.
1	The highest temperatures of sand are normally when females are born. The lowest temperatures are mostly male.
1	i think this claim is true because when the temperature  is warmer most of the butterflies stay inside. When, the temperature is colder most of them stay outside to make there chrysalis.
1	when it is the warmer climates the eggs are female and when the climates are below 85  they are male
1	higher the temperature the more females hatched
1	When I was looking at the evidence, I noticed that all of the males were in sand of the temperature 85.19, and lower. all of the females were born at the temperature of 84.20 and higher. So to conclude the males are born at colder temperatures, and the females were born at slightly warmer temperatures.
1	I think that the graf maps it clear that the populaeshun is going down.
1	The claim is false because I sorted it lowest to highest temperature and the caterpillars was yes, all in one group, but they kept going back 'n' forth. Caterpillar, chrysalis, then back to caterpillars. So therefore the caterpillars will form into papa at different rates in different temperature, however, it changes groups in the same temperature!For instance, 59.36 is in the caterpillar bunch, but, the papa is in 59.54.So maybe temperatures could support faster growth, however, due to the continuous changing i believe that this statement is also incorrect. That is why the statement is partly true, and partly false.
1	I believe that the sand temperature affects whether leatherback eggs hatch as male or female and here's why. because the lower 80s are mostly male the middle temp. 80s are a good mix, and the high 80s are mostly female.
1	I think this is true because if you look at the temperatures 84 degrees and up are all females and if you look at the male temperatures they are all 86 and under.
1	I think the claim is true because the graph shows that the highest temperature shows that the catupiler is in its chrysalis the coldest temperature the butterfly was still a catipiller.
1	The caterpillars all went into their pups when the temperature was 59 degrees (F) or higher.
1	because the butterfly count goes down a lot ever 1 to 2 years
1	when outside it  chrysalis's faster and it's warmer outside
1	In 1968 the temperature was 83.75 and in 2002 the temperature was 86.72 so it was going higher
1	I think the claim is true because outside it is 56.84 degrees  and the butterfly is in the caterpillar stage. The other one says that it is 59.54 degrees and the butterfly in in it's chrysallis stage.
1	If a monarch butter was in a cold temperature area it would take longer because its to cold but if it was really warm the process would go quicker.
1	Why I think it is false is pretty simple. If you look at the table or diagram then it shows in 1960 the temputare of the sand was 84.56 degrees F. And then go 2014 the temputuare is 86.16 degrees F. So that would lead me to believe that the temputuare of the sand is increasing not decreasing.
1	I think this statement is false because I put the temperature in a graph and it seemed to be increasing.
1	The dots on my graph  are all over the place. It goes by the year and count by millions. Some dots are near the bottom and some are near the top. In my chart the numbers range from 33.50 million to 909.50.
1	The temupature since 1860 has been going up until 2000s and started to go down and up.
1	I think that it is false because when it is winter all of the butterfly go to  Mexico. So wen they go there every winter the population will go up.
1	all the females are at a higher tem like 85 butt the males are lower like 80 but some males are at 85 too and some females are as low as 84
1	in the year 2016 the temperature was higher than in 1960
1	Because the monarch butterfly in mexico close to this year is dropping, dropping, and rising, it's never stayed in one place like the tens without bumping up a bit.
1	It has not decreased since 1960 it actually risen a little bit. Because, if you look on the chart 1960 the temperature was 84.56 put then in about ten years it dropped down a little bit but then rose back up, In 2002 the temperature was 86.72. It has risen 1.26 in the temperature.
1	I think this claim is true because when the monarch butterfly was outside and the temperature was at 56.84 it was only a caterpillar. But when a different monarch butterfly was also outside at a temperature of 59.54, it was already  in a chrysalis.
1	the butterfly population has gone down in 1996 it was at 909.50 in. 2013 it is at 33.50.
1	the males are at the bottom and some in the middle, the females are at the top there are three in the middle. Also it said in the beginning that the temperature determines if they are male or female.
1	It has decreased over the years in 1996 it was 909.50 and in 2013 it was 33.50. It has decreased a lot over the years so that statement is false. it almost went down 890.50
1	The chart clearly shows the population decrease from 909 million to 33 million and maybe it is due to natural causes or something happened  on the way
1	I think it is true because male eggs like the sand cooler then female eggs like the sand .The male eggs like 80 to 85 degrees and female like it 84 to 88 degrees.
1	The count overall got smaller.
1	I made a graph to show whether the temperature has been decreasing or not and the graph showed me that the weather has been increasing. So, it is false the weather has not been decreasing
1	When the temperature is higher the butterfly is turning into a chrysalis and soon the chrysalis is turning into a monarch butterfly.
1	In 1960 the sand temperature was 84.56 and in 2016 the sand temperature was 85.57. So clearly it has not been decreasing it has actually been increasing.
1	Every chrysalis tested had a temperature between 59 degrees and 63 degrees. The majority of  the chrysalises were inside.Every caterpillar tested was between 54 and 60 degrees. Most caterpillars were outside. the locations for both were very close between more inside or more outside. Overall, I think it is partially true is because it is true, but the difference in temperature ranges was very small and might not mean anything. Also, the location may or may not have made a difference.
1	from different years it goes up and down but It seems that Its increasing than decreasing. In 2002 and up its going up in heat that getting colder in those years so I presently don't  think its decreasing I think its increasing.
1	in 1960 the temperature was 84.56, but in 2016 the temperature is 85.57. it is going just a little higher
1	One reason why I think that is partly true partly false is if that were true then either 1 or 25 would NOT be the same gender as they are because number 1 (85.80) is only .61 hotter than 25 (85.19). I think it is partly true to because the the data shows Females average 85 and a half maybe more and also shows the Males average 84 and a half so that is why I think that it is partly true and partly false.
1	The graph provided with the investigation shows that commonly the higher temperature sands normally have hatching female turtles unlike hatching male turtles that do their thing in colder sands. Now in the graph, some male turtles hatch in warmer sands than female hatching turtles but not as often as the other way around. I still stick with my decision with true with my reasons conveniently said and the graph for evidence
1	its not the same. the population has jumped around but has gotten smaller. it slowly gets smaller.
1	Most of the chrysalis's are in warmer temps and most of the caterpillars are in cooler temps however, there are a noticeable amount of caterpillars in with  the chrysalis's.
1	I think this is false because the temperatures are around the same number in the 80's.
1	My claim is that the temperature that a chrysalis is in depends on how fast it grows into an adult because, if the temperature is 50 that is not normal for a butterfly to grow in the average temperature is around 60 degrees Fahrenheit. So if it was 50 degrees it would be below what they are used to so it would grow slower.
1	I think that claim 1 is true because when the sand gets hot its most likely that a female will hatch. So when it gets colder some of the males will be born so what I am saying is whenever the sand gets hot a female comes out. Whenever the sand is cold and warm a male will come out.
1	because if it is could the cocoon is cold then it might freeze and when i am outside in the winter i do not see cappella's  or butterfly's. In the summer i think it would be much quicker.
1	Because most of the lower temps. are caterpillars and most of the higher temps. are chrysalis.
1	I think this claim is false because at 1960 it was 84.56. But if you look at my evidence two years after it was 85.10. Through the years the temperature has been getting higher and is not decreasing. Also the temperature got up to 86.72 which has not decreased from 1960. So the temperature of the sand in Rain Island is not decreasing.
1	the population of monarch butterflies has severely gone down from 1996 to 2013
1	Because some male temps are low that means that females are high temps. But some males are quite high in temps.
1	i think it is  true because in this story it said it was faster when it was warm and not when it was cold
1	I think false because, They been going down in the last few years. Also when it goes down also the year is too so this shows something to do with us! Thats why I think its False.
1	I think this claim is true because when the temperature rises, there seem to be more females. between 84.20-85.19 it is kinda scattered but in general, it seems like the lower the temp. the more males, but the higher the temp. the more females. since this claim doesn't go into many specifics, I think we could say yes, the sand temperature affects the gender of the turtles.
1	well most females in the data are born in 85.50 degrees  or more and most males are born below 85.50 degrees. all but 2 females are bore in less 80.50 degrees. and there not 1 male is born in more that 80.50. so its not exactly true but it is party true
1	Look at 1968, 83.75 degrees, and then look at 2016, 85.57 degrees the temperature goes higher not lower.
1	i believe that the sand can affect the gender some times because in the data that shows has the highest temperatures on top with the lowest on bottom and almost all of the high temps are female rather than male one of the highest temps is 88.08 and is female as well as 87.09, 86.97, 86.54, 86.26, those are the highest temps and they are all female the lowest temperature of the female in this test is 84.20 but most of the males is 83.31, 83.25, 82.45, 82.29, the highest of the males in this test is 85.19 quite low to the female turtles. I did say that this thought was partly true/partly false for these reasons
1	because in the hotter temperature the female eggs hatched
1	It hasn't stayed about the same because if you look at the amount of butterflies in 1996 is higher and the number just keeps going down and down over the years.
1	I think the claim is false because in 1960 the temperature was 84.66 on Rain island. Over 58 years it has increased and decreased but in 2018 it has gone up to 85.67.
1	The population went down almost 900 million in only 17 years. The butterfly population went down 13 million in one year. Therefore, the population is going down rapidly!
1	I said what I said because of males where more cornix born in colder places
1	because its going down every year
1	the leather back turtles gender is of the heat the females are mostly hotter than the males. the two that i pointed to were a boy and a girl the girls 5 hotter than the boy
1	I think this claim is true because the caterpillars that were in warmer places have already gone to chrysalis stage. where as the other ones are still in caterpillar stage.
1	I think this claim is false because if you look at the evidence you see that it has barely going up, and it has stayed in the 80's for most of the years.
1	I think that it is true because when the temperature is higher there are mostly chrysalis and when it is colder there are more caterpillars.
1	Lots of the turtles that were raised in a cooler environment were males. A piece of evidence is from 80.60 to 83.85 are all males. The females are manly in the group with higher temperature. For example from 85.42 to 88.08 are all females.
1	The top of the Life Cycle Stage List where it is colder has all caterpillars and at the bottom of the list where it is hotter has a lot of chrysalis's I think that when it is warmer they go threw their stages faster and when it is colder they go threw their stages slower
1	why i believe that tempicher effects weather they are male or female because if you look on the cart most male eggs have lower tepicer and female has higher tempicher that is my reason why
1	When you sort the data from low to high,you can clearly see that the claim is partly true. On the lower side of the chart, it is only male but in the middle some of the temps. Run up to 85.19 address. Which was uncommon for the sex. With is why only part of the claim is true.
1	Well, when I sorted the data by temperature lowest to highest, I looked at the life cycle stages and first there were a chunk of caterpillar  and then chrysalis  then more caterpillars back and fourth. I think that if the claim was true then all the caterpillars would be together and all the chrysalis would be together.
1	I think this question is true because when the temperatures are getting warmer there are lots of chrysalis'. But when it is a little colder out there are mostly caterpillars.
1	on the chart, the temperature has gone not far down and pretty far up. i see that the temp has gone mostly up so it is not decreasing too much.
1	I think it is partly true party false. If you look at the claim it is (the sand temperature affects weather leatherback eggs hatch as male or female.) Then look at the chart male temperature is from 85.19 to 80.60. Then look at female the temperature is from 88.8 to 84.20 so to me it looks like that if there is a higher temperature then there is a female and a lower temperature for a male. But I only think it is partly true partly false because the temperatures 84 and 85 are both in range for them both.
1	I know the temperature of the monarch butterfly's habitat affects how quickly it goes through its life cycle stages is because when I sort the data by cold to hot and most of the hot temperature was the chrysalis meaning they do better in hot places
1	I think that it partially matters what temperature it is for a monarch butterfly to effect how fast it's life cycle goes because when i was looking at the data i noticed that if the temperature was over or at 60.48 then it was more likely to be in a chrysalis.
1	I think this claim is partly true because most of the the ones in the 60's are chrysalises and most of the 50's are not
1	I say that it is false because the weather is staying at the mid 85-88 and that means it is only getting warmer not colder
1	The lower temperature they are in the caterpillar stage and in the higher temperature they are in a chrysalis stage.
1	I think this claim is true because whether sea turtles lay there eggs in the sand and the different temperatures that effect in there eggs shell could change there formation of themselves. To turn into to a male or female. Also I notice that the temperatures stay in the eighties maybe  that also has something to do with it. Males usually in Surname tend to stat around in under the 85's but females on the other hand stay above an 85 maybe that's a reason the come out male or female.
1	when i shorter the years i  the new one is the hottest with 85.57 and the last is 84.56
1	I think it's partly true/partly false because from the data outside is kind of warmer then inside and in the higher temperatures the monarchs are already at the chrysalis stage. In the article it said that monarchs move to warmer places in the winter. Places that are not to cold and not to warm. But I also think it is partly false too because looking at the data some monarchs that are inside are in chrysalis.
1	I think the claim is false because in 1996 the butterfly population is 909.50 million and in 2013 the butterfly population is 33.50 million and there is a big difference in 33.50 million and 909.50 million. So the butterfly population has gone down a lot
1	I see that the males mostly hatch in a little colder sand. I also see that the females are mostly born in sand that is a little bit warmer then the males. I think that the fact is partly true because that is not true for some of the turtles.
1	I think true because if a monarch butterfly's habitat is cold then it  will not be able to transfer throw out all of the other stages in its life cycle, but if a monarch butterfly's habitat is warm then it will be able to transfer throw the stages. Just like if a human goes out side in the cold then the fluids inside of your body will not stay warm, but if you are inside and it is warm inside then the fluids in your body will keep running faster throw out your body.
1	I think this claim is false because if you see on the data when monarch butterfly's  are inside they can be a caterpillar or a chrysalis. But on the outside it shows that it can be the same as the indoor. Also as you can see lower temperatures and higher temperatures can both be caterpillars or chrysalis's. So I don't believe the temperature affects them or the habitat.
1	When the sand temperature is hotter the eggs hatch as female, and when the sand is cooler the eggs hatch as male. For example, some of the male egg temperature were, 80.60, 82.45, and 83.25. But then some of the female temperatures were, 87.09, 88.08 and 86.54, so there is a big difference in those temperatures which means that the eggs hatch as female when the sand is hotter, and the eggs hatch as male when the sand is cooler.
1	The highest temperature was in 2002. The lowest temperature was in 1968. On my graph the temperature was going up and down not just a line going down. If anything the temperature is going up for 1960.
1	When the temperature is higher its seems to male it slower because all of the chrysalis is 59 degrees or above and all of the caterpillars are 60 degrees and under. The chrysalis stage comes first and is all a higher temp than the caterpillars stage is after the chrysalis stage and is a lowe temp.
1	i think that this is partly true because the article said that the weather cant be too cold and cant be to warm. i think this could affect how they grow, if the monarch butterfly are in too warm of weather they could not grow properly. if they are in too cold of weather they could take longer to grow, or even worst die. i do agree that it can cause them to to grow. if monarch butterfly are in to warm or harsh weather it could cause the population to go down in stead of up. that is why i think climate can cause butterfly to not grow.
1	We believe this is false because since 1960 the temperatures have risen.
1	I am seeing that the life cycle In affected by the temp. of their habitat.Some evidence that my claim is true is that 60 Degrees *f is when they start turning in to caterpillars but over 60 is chryalises.
1	Some are saying that the temperature of the sand in Rain Island, Australia has been decreasing since 1960. This information is incorrect. As I have made my graph of data that has been collected from the past years, I have found that the temperatures have gone up since 1960, not gone down.
1	I think it is not true because it side it was decreasing when it has been going up for the most part it only goes down a little bit!
1	i think this claim is partly true and false because monarch count has stayed in the millions but the numbers have gone way lower. since 1996
1	The claim is false because in 1996 their where 909.5 million butterfly's in Mexico. But in 2008 the butterfly population has gone down to 253 million and it decreased from there. Until 2013 where there was only 33.5 million butterfly's in Mexico so it is pretty obvious that the claim is false because the butterfly population went down 876 million in 17 years.
1	We believe the temperature of the sand does contribute to male or female eggs.  Male's were primarily hatched in the low 80's to 83 range.  Females were primarily hatched in the 85 - 88 range.
1	In 1960 Temperature was 84.56 and in 2016 the Temperature was 85.57 so it increased.
1	according to the chart higher temperatures seem to have female eggs and lower the temperatures seem to have more male. but in the middle of the chart mae and female are a little mixed up.
1	i think this claim is false because the data table shows that as years go on the population have been increasing and decreasing. Also thats happening because butterflies go there when it gets to cold or to hot where they live and it degrees when they leave to go somewhere else.
1	As I quickly looked through the location, and went onto temperature where I looked and saw that mainly the monarch butterfly does turn into the chrysalis quicker at hotter temperatures whether inside or outside.
1	When you look at the chart pay attention to the numbers of the population. It was going downward! In 1993 the population was 3 million to 1996, 9 million now look at 2013, 33 million! It was in the hundred million not 10 million! You can not say it has stayed the same when it fell down to 10 million. I think the claim is False!
1	I think that it is partially true because it shows that the warmer the temperature the faster it will grow but, I believe this only goes for when the caterpillar is outside because it seems that when a caterpillar is inside it doesn't grow as quickly because  it's not in it's natural habitat.
1	I think this claim is partly true and partly false. I think this because if you look at the males most of them have lower temperatures than the females. Most males are 85 to 80 for their temperatures. As you see most females are 85 and up. But some males are higher than 85 and some females are lower than 85. But as you see most females are higher than 85 and most males are lower than 85.
1	when the feature became hotter and more dense the butterfly started going through the cycles of their transformation
1	I think this claim is true because all the females numbers are within a couple of numbers of each other. And it is the same for male.I think this because in the data it says on one piece of evidence that it was 85.82 degrees and it was a female then another one said 85.54 and that was a female. another reason i think this is because in the data it says 80.56 and it was a male then another one said 80.60 and that was a male to.in conclusion I think claim 1 is true.
1	After 11 days there were more chrysalises when it was warmer and more caterpillars as it got colder. So warmer temps make the monarch butterfly's life cycle go faster.
1	Most of the male eggs are hatched in cooler weather, however most of the female eggs are in a little bit warmer weather
1	The highest count of butterfly was in 1996 and ever since then it has dropped rapidly over the past 17 years. And it has dropped by over 800 million, so it has not been staying the same.
1	In the data shown in the picture it looks like the lower the temperature the slower the life cycle is.The data also shows the higher the temperature the faster the life cycle is.
1	I think this claim is partly true and false because the monarch count has stayed in the millions but the numbers have increasingly have gone way lower sense 1996.
1	In 1962 the temperature was at 85.10 degrees. and you keep going up in years the temperature goes up and down depending on the weather. In 2008 the temperature was at 85.21. That is a increase if anything in the temperature. it was a 0.11 increase in heat.
1	If your looking at the chart, the females temperature is much higher than the males but, some of the temperatures are the same for both the genders. Thats why I think its partly true.
1	If you look at the years under the year 2000 they have all smaller temperatures than the sand in the 2000's. So that means that the temperature increased actually.
1	The sand temperature affects whether leatherback eggs hatch as male or female because looking at the data, males have lower temperatures while the females have more.
1	i think it's false because it says they started tracking in 1993 and from 1993 to 2013 the population has gone down instead of staying the same it went from 909 million to 33 million.This is why i think that the monarch butterfly's population didn't stay the same.
1	The lower the temperature is, the slower the life cycle goes.
1	as the temperature ranged from 57-62 the caterpillars turned into stage 3 crysiless depending on the location this could be caused by humidity outside or inside but as it got warmer they changed mostly on the warmer side inside and a little cooler outside again probably from humidity
1	because some are a high temperature and the monarchs are still caterpillars but some of the low temperatures are chrysalises
1	All higher temperatures above 59.50 are in stage 3 or 4 because of how high the temperature is in there location. But just 6 of them are still in stage 2 though.I have thought about it and came up with this theory, they may have been born just went the temperature was warmer and they still are growing fast but just have not made the cut.
1	because most of the time there are male and female sometimes there are just female and sometimes the a just males because male need to be colder to the ground or the won't be a male they will then be a female. female need to be warmer than the males if there to cold they will most likely to be a male
1	every year since 1996 the monarch butterfly population has gone down every time a new year comes so the butterfly population cannot be the same if in 1996 909.50 million butterflies and the in 2013 there are only 33.50 million they have gone down by about 878 million
1	The temperature for male eggs was between 80-86, which is lower than the 84-87 that the female eggs had. I believe that if the egg is warmer, females will hatch. If it's colder, males will hatch.
1	The monarch butterfly population has decreased by millions. The amount in 1996 909.50, to 2013 33.50. That was a HG decrease in population. I should have their job because I even know that.
1	the weather makes the monarch slow done if it is to cold out they stay as caterpillars and when it is hot they grow up faster. They grow faster if they eat more.they grow slow if it is 61 to 54 farinhitemost of these are still caterpillars because it is still cold
1	i think its partly true and partly false because number 1 and  2 are both 85 degrees and one is male and ones female but numbers 19 and 20 is a big different 19 is 80 degrees and its a male and 20 is 86 degrees and a female
1	all of the chrysalis are 60 or above and all of the caterpillar are below 59
1	in the lower temperature there are mainly males till 84.20 then it is mixed till 85.42 where the rest are al female
1	I think its partly true/ partly false because in some parts it's colder than the warm temperature and it still said chrysalis.
1	If you look at the temperatures from lowest to highest, you see that all the lowest temperatures say caterpillar and the higher temperatures say chrysalis. This shows that the temperature of the habitat affects how quickly monarch butterfly's life cycle stages change.
1	In 1996 the count was 909.50 million and just a year after it dropped to 630.50 and all the way up in 2013 the count was 33.50 million so it has dropped about 880 million.
1	The higher temperature are mostly female and the lower temperature are mostly male. I said partly true partly false because some male sea turtles are high temperatures and some female sea turtles are in the lower temperatures.
1	Each year the count goes done
1	As you can see in the data...over the years the butterfly population in Mexico has changed. There were way more butterflies in the 90's. in the 2000's the numbers died down , but in the early and late 2010's it slowly started rising again.
1	The temperature was going up.
1	yes because of its temporal is raising.
1	when you go to the 1960 the temps were 84 and when you go to dates higher up you see the actually increase
1	Normal when the temp is in the 60's they usually are in their chrysalis period of transformation. But one of the chrysalis periods is in the 50 to 59 degree range.
1	I think that wen it gets hotel it seams that the spearhead gross faster as you see in the graf.
1	when the caterpillar is in his chrysalis stage it is hotel but when it is in its normal stage it is ship less worm [OT: graded out rows already coded in Feb13 file]
1	this fact is false because as i move down the data chart from beginning to end it starts at 33.50 and goes to 909.50 the count of butterfly's in Mexico have gone way up.
1	I think it is partly true and partly false because most of the sand that was 85 or higher were females, and most of the sand that 85 or lower were males. It isn't like this through the whole thing.
1	there has been forest fires in Australia. its been alot hotter there since before the fire
1	the butterfly population has dropped at increasing speeds instead of staying the same, the evidence is in 1996 the butterfly population was 909.50 million and in 2013 it is at 33.50 million.
1	The scientists are saying that the butterfly's population is staying the same but from 1996 to 2013 they have lost loads of butterfly's and the scientists are saying that the butterfly's population in Mexico is staying about the same.
1	I think it is true because a lot of the low temperatures are males and high is mostly female.
1	In Playa most of the females sand temperature is higher than the males sand temperature. Like number 1 Playa 85.80 was a female. then number 8 at Playa 80.67 was a male. So it must make a difference if the temperature of the sand is high or low because almost all of the lower ones are male and most of the higher ones are female.
1	when the temperature is lower most of the butterfly are still caterpillars and when the temperature is higher most of the butterfly are chrysalis
1	I think that the temperature affects the turtle eggs hatching male or female because as you can see on my graph, most of the lower temperatures are male, and the higher temperatures are female.
1	it does affect how quickly it goes through the life cycle because there are more chrysalis in the warmer weather so the colder weather makes it harder for them to go through life cycle stages.
1	I think it is false because through the years the population has gone down 100's. For example the population has gone down 876.000 (876 hundredth), from 909.50 to only 33.50. So that is why I think that it is false.
1	The temperature of the monarch butterfly's habitat can kind of affect how fast they change if the conditions are to hot they might form faster than if the conditions were cooler. the butterfly's can sometimes be in the sand and if they are lower in the sand they wont get as hot but  the higher up they are in the sand the hotter they will get and might form faster. if they are i sand they can change all kinds of speeds but it can all depends on where they are in the sand.
1	because it is not staying the same actually it is getting lower
1	In the graph, you can see many of the females were found in Playa and many of the males in Surname. The temperature for the females is mostly high ranging from 88-84. From this, we can make the claim that females spawn in warmer climates. As the males spawn in cooler areas.
1	if anything the temperature has bean going up in stead of down because if you look is goes from 84.56 all the way to 85.57
1	I do not think it has been decreasing because the graph shows otherwise. The data shows the sand going higher from year to year. In 1960 the temperature of the sand was 84.56, and in 2016 (most resent year on graph) the sand was 85.57. So it was not decreasing at all it was actually increasing.
1	After studying the data I conclude that the sea turtles who were born when the sand temperatures were 84 degrees primarily turned out as females. But when the temperatures were 83.99 degrees and below the sea turtle were males.
1	I think this because if you look at the graph, then you can see that the average of female turtles are born in the warmer temperatures and the male turtles are born in the more cold temperatures.
1	I say yes because it seems that the male are in the low 80s and that the male also and the female are hatching as female in the high 80s
1	I think this is files because most of the higher the textures are still in the chrysallis stage
1	I think its true because if you look at the data on the chart you can see that male turtles are hatched when the sand temperature is 85.04 and below and the females temperature is  is 85.04 and higher.
1	I think that the second claim is wrong because if you look at the chart close  enough you will see that the butterfly population is increasing in Mexico its not staying the same because if you at the chart under the word count the numbers show that the population is increasing not staying the same.
1	The reason why I think it is false is because it the data there is about the same amount of male and female turtles in each location. I also think this because in the data there is not much proof that the temperature affects the gender of the turtle.
1	i think is is true because the lowest for males to spawn is 80.60 temp and the lowest for females is 84.20 temp so the hotter the sand it will be a female the colder the sand is it going to be a male and that's why the sand temperature affects if it's a male or female
1	I believe that the claim is partly true and partly false because in some parts it shows that maybe the cooler temperatures can change the affects is has on the life cycles but also the temperature is not really changing the affects because there may be a section where a cooler temperature shows that the life cycle is in the caterpillar form then is switches to a chrysalis but it can then switch back to the caterpillar making me believe it is partly true and partly false.
1	as the years go by they get lesser and lesser from 909 million to 33 million
1	the monarch is a caterpillar when it is below 59 degrees and its a chrysalis when it is 59 degrees or higher.  But not always, #3 was a caterpillar while it was 59.36 degrees and #29 was still a cater pillar when it was 60.90 degrees.
1	if it is warm out it will change faster than if it is cold
1	Some males where  born in hot texture same as females. It goes back and forth to say the heat affects the gender, if you say that  the hotter sand has females you would problem wrong  next time some males where born in high texture  thats why its problem false.
1	I think this claim is false because as the years go on the temperatures are not staying about the same. Sometimes one year is millions more than the other. Through out the year it has gone up and down with less millions and more millions. So I believe this claim is false.
