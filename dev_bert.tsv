a	391	0	i think this because the temperature is going down and then going right back to the temperature it was at before.
a	636	0	astralias nesting area is the most importent nesting area so it cant be decresing
a	280	0	so on my chart i changed it to temp and it shows the colder it is the more likely to become a Caterpillar faster then the hotter places in the hotter places they are still in there chrysalis so it does affect how fast it goes through the life cycle and if i were a butterfly i would want to live in a colder place because i'm impatient.
a	134	0	because the male turtles have to stay safe and if we are being honest i don't remember the question
a	639	0	I put every year in order and then looked at the count (millions). Then, I realized that there were numbers of all different places. Some were higher and some were lower. For example, in 2009, the amount was 96.00 and in 1996, the monarch count was 909.50.
a	2	0	I think that the temperature effects how quickly it goes threw its life cycle stages partly true/partly false. Because when it is inside it has no place to do its stages and its temperature is to high or low. Also, It is different when its a chrysalis because, whether inside or outside its about the same temperature either way.
a	316	0	I think it is partly true/ partly false. I think this  if you look at the data, it will go back and fourth between chrysalis and caterpillar. Right in the middle of the data it goes back and fourth. there will sometimes be a caterpillar in the beginning. I believe that it could help to study the location of the butter fly. and if it is inside or outside a building/structure.
a	647	0	I think the claim is partly true because the temp. of the sand kind of went up and down.
a	345	0	if it was cold it probably not hatch
a	460	1	In 1960 the temperature was 84.56 and the temperature kept getting higher not decreasing.\n
a	168	0	it is the same speed going throthe life sicel.
a	423	1	I say that it is false because the weather is staying at the mid 85-88 and that means it is only getting warmer not colder
a	237	0	if the caterpillar is in the cold weather wean it is in a chrysalis it would slow it down the save its energy.
a	533	1	The claim is false because in 1996 their where 909.5 million butterfly's in Mexico. But in 2008 the butterfly population has gone down to 253 million and it decreased from there. Until 2013 where there was only 33.5 million butterfly's in Mexico so it is pretty obvious that the claim is false because the butterfly population went down 876 million in 17 years.
a	163	0	it goes up and down in the data.
a	60	1	why i bileve that tempicher effects weather they are male or female because if you look on the cart most male eggs have lower tepicer and female has higher tempicher that is my reason why
a	80	0	Because you have to know the butterfly's temperature if you are going to learn about them\n
a	174	1	When the sand temperature is hotter the eggs hatch as female, and when the sand is cooler the eggs hatch as male. For example, some of the male egg temperature were, 80.60, 82.45, and 83.25. But then some of the female temperatures were, 87.09, 88.08 and 86.54, so there is a big difference in those temperatures which means that the eggs hatch as female when the sand is hotter, and the eggs hatch as male when the sand is cooler.
a	622	1	because it is not staying the same actully it is getting lower
a	626	0	The claim is that temperature of the the sand in Raine has been decreasing since 1960. I think that it is sort of true, because the highest the highest temp. that the sand reached was 86.72. that was in 2002. the lowest temp. that the sand reached was 83.75, that was in 1968. so the sand has been getting to temps. in between both those numbers.
a	585	0	"It said ""The temperature of the sand in Raine Island, Australia had been decreasing since 1960"" In the sentence"
a	425	0	I really don't know
a	454	0	it is very important to know understand protect these beautiful  animals
a	297	1	I think the claim is true because in the information I recently got almost all the lowest are outside of the chrysalis and some off the highest are still inside of the chrysalis so my point is that the higher the temperature the longer your in the chrysalis.
a	138	1	When you sort the data from low to high,you can clearly see that the claim is partly true. On the lower side of the chart, it is only male but in the middle some of the temps. Run up to 85.19 dagress. Which was uncommen for the sex. Wich is why only part of the claim is true.
a	383	0	i think this claim is false because, you can see in  1996 there were 909.50 monarch butterfly a year. now in 2013 there are only 33.50 that is a big difference. its because of the weather and global warming. that is why i think that claim is false. i am not saying they are  wrong but i am giving my thoughts and telling them why i think that.
a	702	0	I think this because the graph didn't show anything about the turtle amount.\n
a	481	1	there has been forest fires in Australia. its been alot hotter there since before the fire
a	518	0	you need to start at 1993 and count up till 2018
a	407	0	I think it would be partly true and partly false because the temperature of the sand and rain   island , Australia BUT IT THINK IT PROBALEY WOULD BE TRUE
a	495	1	In 1962 the temperature was at 85.10 degrees. and you keep going up in years the temperature goes up and down depending on the weather. In 2008 the temperature was at 85.21. That is a increase if anything in the temperature. it was a 0.11 increase in heat.
a	51	0	I think this claim is true because if its cold the butterflies are gonna want to be in their Chrysalis. Like when you are cold you wouldn't want to be outside in the cold you want to be raped up in your blanket cause its warmer.
a	310	1	The reason why I think it is false is because it the data there is about the same amount of male and female turtles in each location. I also think this because in the data there is not much proof that the temperature affects the gender of the turtle.
a	308	0	its partly true because sea turtles do lay there eggs in the sand its partly false because the sand temperature does not help the eggs hatch into a boy or a girl
a	483	1	i think it's false because it says they started tracking in 1993 and from 1993 to 2013 the population has gone down instead of staying the same it went from 909 million to 33 million.This is why i think that the monarch butterfly's population didn't stay the same.
a	288	1	I think it is partly true party false. If you look at the claim it is (the sand temperature affects weather leatherback eggs hatch as male or female.) Then look at the chart male temperature is from 85.19 to 80.60. Then look at female the temperature is from 88.8 to 84.20 so to me it looks like that if there is a higher temperature then there is a female and a lower temperature for a male. But I only think it is partly true partly false because the temperatures 84 and 85 are both in range for them both.
a	248	0	I think it is true because different habitats can have an effect on stuff like the food there. not the right food can affect its life stages life, for example, it could be late on becoming a butterfly or like it could be a caterpillar for longer than it should
a	427	0	I think it's true because from 1994 to 2006 there has been about ten more or less than the year before and/or the year after that.
a	529	0	The temperatures
a	67	0	i said no because it says on the top temperature 85.80 and its a female and on the 2nd one down is says 85.04 and its a male
a	354	0	because the sometimes they will momentarily leave the area
a	444	0	I think this is false because in 1960 the temperature was 84.56 and the the temperature in 1962 was 85.10 so its been going up not down.
a	154	0	I think this is true because the tempertature can effect how the butterfly can grow, also how fast it grows.
a	506	0	they went up 1 or 2 but some went down 1
a	86	0	I dont know
a	108	0	I think it is because if its cold the butterfly might freeze and if they are warm they will have a longer lifespan and they migrate so if the to some place warm and the tempature changes they might die
a	394	0	This claim is false because there is barely a decline in temperature. If you were to say that there is a decline you would need to know it only drops down 1 degree every few years. In the graph, you can see that in 2000,1994, 1992, 1974, 1988, and 1962, it stays 85 degrees Fahrenheit.
a	126	0	I don't think that the temperature affects there gender because they were already made in the costumier of the turtle. So if I was in my moms costumier and it was hot I don't think that would affect my gender. But this is a hole different animal. But its not able to switch its gender.\nA mom cant just say i want a girl. that's not possible.
a	282	1	I think this claim is false because if you see on the data when monarch butterfly's  are inside they can be a caterpillar or a chrysalis. But on the outside it shows that it can be the same as the indoor. Also as you can see lower temperatures and higher temperatures can both be caterpillars or chrysalis's. So I don't believe the temperature affects them or the habitat.
a	179	1	The reason why is because the 8th sample was at Playa it was 80.67 degrees and it was a male and the 9th sample it was at the same place and the temperature was 84.20 and it was a female. So the warmer it is it is a female the colder it is it is a male. Every temperature that is over 84 degrees is a female every temperature that is under 84 degrees is a male.\n
a	541	0	because if sea turtles don't have enough sand they can't burrie there eggs and if they do predators will get to them.
a	84	1	because some are a high temperature and the monarchs are still caterpillars but some of the low temperatures are chrysalises
a	55	0	think that the tempter dose not matter as long as the butter file can survive.
a	302	0	I think it is partly true partly false, its partly true because i realize that female baby turtles are born with higher tempatures and males are born with lower tempatures, and I can understand that. But I also think its partly false because number 2 (male) has 85.04, and number 28 (female) has a tempature in the range of 84, so does number 3 and number 9. Im a little confused of what this means and I think that if females are born in that area, the should be males.
a	378	1	The population went down almost 900 million in only 17 years. The butterfly population went down 13 million in one year. Therefore, the population is going down rapidly!
a	238	1	as the temprature ranged from 57-62 the catarrpillars turned into stage 3 crysiless depending on the location this could be caused by humidity outside or inside but as it got warmer they changed mostly on the warmer side inside and a little cooler outside again probably from humidity
a	445	0	I dont know\n
a	48	1	The sand temperature affects whether leather-back eggs hatch as male or female because scientific research proves that when the eggs have been laid in warmer sand, the turtle is a female. When the egg is laid in cooler sand, the turtle is a male. Also, These turtles have been laid in different locations. So we know that in Playa the turtles don't tend to be female. That part is totally random. The Male and Female's were both scattered around Playa and Suriname.
a	609	0	I think false because I assorted the data table by lowest to highest year and from 1960-2016 the range in temperature stayed within  83-86 it could not be decreasing.
a	590	1	if you look at the chart you can see that over the years the population has slightly but steadily dropped like in 2013 there was 33.50 million monarchs but in 2014 there was 56.0.
a	50	0	i think that if the temperature where to change the speed of the butterfly's growth then all the factors in the butterfly's life would change the speed of the butterfly growth and its life cycle i think maybe the winter could make them die so that why they go down to other areas such as Mexico and based on the data it says that the chrysalis was in 63 degree weather and that was the top degrees in this hole graph so that shows that the weather doesn't speed the life cycle of the monarch butterfly's.
a	688	0	The temperature of the sand in Raine Island, Australia has been decreasing since 1960.
a	655	0	I think it's false because in the data It looks like the population for monarch in Mexico is decreaseing. In 1993 the population of monarch in Mexico was 311.50. I think it was increasing and now it is decreasing. The highest year on the data chart is 2017 the population is 124.00 in 2017.
a	544	0	the highest population was in 2006
a	372	0	vanessa
a	498	0	because of their ar fewer turtles
a	327	0	3 males were born in very hot sand and 2 females were born in cold\nsand
a	63	0	i think that the statement was true because a butterfly cant be in the cold for as long as a caterpillar can because of the high winds and over the rain or snow coming down with all the hard pressure.
a	380	0	Sam
a	353	0	Beacues the heat does not damage it but it could
a	329	0	I think that it may be true because the highest temperature was a female and the lowest temperatures were all male. But i'm not positive all of the way because when the temperature got to around 84 degrees, it switched into like a pattern of male female male female female and then went onto the rest of the temps witch were only male.
a	459	0	"I think that this is incorrect information because it states ""...the monarch butterfly population in mexico has stayed about the same.""\nHowever, as you see in my graph, through the years the population has gone anywhere from a bit less than 100 million to 900 million!\nDue to they scattering of the population I believe that in the past recorded years the population hasn\'t decreased, or increased. It has went back and forth, meaning that it is not only healthy, but that it is going on a natural in predicable course.\nSo, in conclusion, claim #2 is completely incorrect."
a	206	0	I think this is true because if you read 20 you can see why I think it is the right answer.
a	355	1	Look at 1968, 83.75 degrees, and then look at 2016, 85.57 degrees the temperature goes higher not lower.
a	387	1	This thought is partly true/partly false because the sand in the 1960's through the 1982's these years had the lowest temps in theses years all the other years above that mostly are higher numbers\n
a	570	0	The monarch butterfly stays in mexico because it likes the heat.\n
a	488	1	I think this claim is false because if you look at the evidence you see that it has barely going up, and it has stayed in the 80's for most of the years.
a	30	0	the temperature does affect the life cycle of butterflies according to the evidence on the table.
a	145	0	I think its false because if stage 3 froze than i will take more time to unfreeze.
a	277	1	I think this is false because the temperatures are around the same number in the 80's.
a	217	0	there wore more boys than girls but  they were pretty close the same amount so that's why I said it was partly true and partly false
a	79	0	it shows that the higher temperature always gets female and every low temperature would be male
a	171	0	because there all in the 80 to 85 temperature so it cant be because of the temperature. Some of them are almost the same temperatures but there different genders.\n
a	575	0	when you look at the graph, you can see it stayed about the same, other than a sudden spike in 1995 and 1996.
a	359	1	I think the claim is false because in 1996 the butterfly population is 909.50 million and in 2013 the butterfly population is 33.50 million and there is a big difference in 33.50 million and 909.50 million. So the butterfly population has gone down a lot
a	591	0	If it stayed about the same it would have been in the 30s but now it went from thirty three to 56.50 within a year.
a	321	1	The table shows that lower temperatures are males and higher temperatures are female
a	548	0	true because everything ranges from 0 to 900
a	550	0	its false because the count is going higher over the years.
a	333	0	because I said so
a	583	0	"It said ""The temperature of the sand in Raine Island, Australia had been decreasing since 1960"" In the sentence"
a	386	0	it is partly true and partly false because it has gone up and done in the different years it has changed over all the years it has gone up and down
a	204	1	there are more female in the higher temp and the males are in the lower temp and they kind of mix in the middle
a	592	1	the butterfly population has gone down in 1996 it was at 909.50 in. 2013 it is at 33.50.
a	152	0	a male was born i 86.54 temp
a	322	1	In the data shown in the picture it looks like the lower the temperature the slower the life cycle is.The data also shows the higher the temperature the faster the life cycle is.
a	287	1	I see that the males mostly hatch in a little colder sand. I also see that the females are mostly born in sand that is a little bit warmer then the males. I think that the fact is partly true because that is not true for some of the turtles.
a	596	0	i think its true because it said in the subtitle that this was true.
a	367	0	"I think this is true because in the winter time when they go to hibernate I think that most of all butterfly""s go to mexico because it is the most right temperature for the butterfly\'s to stay at mexico longer in the winter."
a	328	0	I think that this is false because when you are a caterpillar you are not inside of you egg or chrysalis. And it says that when the caterpillar is in their chrysalis then are outside of their chrysalis. So like they are not even in it.
a	708	0	because more monarch butterfly's are coming in to Mexico
a	74	1	the monarch is a caterpillar when it is bellow 59 degrees and its a chrysalis when it is 59 degrees or higher.  But not always, #3 was a caterpillar while it was 59.36 degrees and #29 was still a cater pillar when it was 60.90 degrees.
a	438	0	The answer to the question is false.  It is false because the information I am getting says that it has gone up a lot more.
a	429	0	In 1993, when scientists started keeping track, there where 311.50 million Monarchs, but in 2018 there were 302.50 million Monarchs.
a	392	0	i think this is false because the evedace shows the number of butter go up\n
a	477	0	i think that it is parlty true and partly false. i think this because even though it is about the same  dosen't mean that it did not drop before.
a	629	0	Sample one has 33.50 million buterflies.Sample number 8 has 145.50. The numbers go higher every sample number.
a	113	0	i'm not good with math\n
a	157	0	Different butterflies are at different stages and the temperature  has nothing to do with how fast the butterfly goes through the stages of its life.
a	142	1	The temperature of the monarch butterfly's habitat can kind of affect how fast they change if the conditions are to hot they might form faster than if the conditions were cooler. the butterfly's can sometimes be in the sand and if they are lower in the sand they wont get as hot but  the higher up they are in the sand the hotter they will get and might form faster. if they are i sand they can change all kinds of speeds but it can all depends on where they are in the sand.
a	410	0	i think the claim is false because the number of butter flies has changed
a	188	1	Yes this is true because I sorted the temps from low to high, and on average the lower temps were all male hatchlings. and the high temps were all female, so yes there is a corallation between sand temperature and the the gender of the eggs of leatherback turtles.
a	582	0	I think its partly true and partly false because it could have changed it could have not changed
a	471	1	Because when You Look At Them It starts at 909.50 and goes all the way down to 33.50. So It Dropped Very Low When through the years.
a	606	0	I think this because some years there very little and some years there was a lot.
a	31	0	i think it is true partly true and partly false because if they are in a really cold environment it probably would affect it when it comes out but it is partly not because when they are in the crystallites it can not affect them as much as when they come out
a	492	0	When the years went by the monarch butter flies population goes up little by little. so that means the population did not stay the same.
a	243	0	it keeps the eggs warm\n
a	169	1	I think this claim is partly true because most of the the ones in the 60's are chrysalises and most of the 50's are not
a	514	0	if it did rain since 1960 the sand will be wet
a	10	1	I think that this is true because mostly the females are born in hotter sands but all the temputaures are close together which would make me conclude that it would be true. Climate change might over populate the sea turles because if more femals are born in hotter snads that there is going to be a lot more female sea turtles to lay there eggs. This could also impact the population in a different way. That way being there would be not enough males so they could not mate. So that would make the population drop.
a	118	0	As you can see the claim is false one of the female leatherbacks are 82.45 and it was at suriname and a difrent leatherback was 86.97 and it was at suriname so it is false
a	484	0	It could be because of rain and the temp in the air around the sand that makes the sand colder. its defiantly going down.
a	457	0	I think its False because its not the first one to be the lowest number
a	538	0	frghn
a	304	1	Because most of the lower temps. are caterpillars and most of the higher temps. are chrysalis.
a	674	0	when I sorted the temperatures from lowest to highest the highest temperature was in 2002 so i do not think they have been going down since 1960
a	512	0	The count of butterflies in mexico go down and up alot. This is due to the evidence on the chart. But mexico seems to have more butterflies in the late 90's. But in the closer years (like 2017 and 2016) they have a fair amount of monarch butterflies.
a	207	0	Sample 1 & Sample 2 were about the same temp but were Male and Female.\n\nBut in Sample 23 & 24 the temp was 4 degress different,but were also Male and Female.
a	517	0	I think it is kinda true that the population has stayed the same because in the summer i haven't seen alot of them but, their could be alot and i just don't see them so i think it is kinda true and kinda not true.
a	351	0	there are no other resons
a	578	0	it is false because every year it is going up and up (the number in butterflys are increasing).
a	133	1	I think it is partly true and partly false because most of the sand that was 85 or higher were females, and most of the sand that 85 or lower were males. It isn't like this through the whole thing.
a	68	1	I say yes because it seems that the male are in the low 80s and that the male also and the female are hatching as female in the high 80s
a	417	1	in the year 2016 the temperature was higher than in 1960
a	666	0	There is no patteren of the population, and the numbers deffenetly aren't the same.
a	468	0	this is why i think that the answer is true because up in the right corner  it says that in mexico the population stayed about the same.
a	364	0	I think that is partly true and partly false because overtime in 1960 the temperature was 84 degrees it did get hotter but it did call down sometime but golble warming witch is making the weather warmer also it goes down and up so i guess it is kind of the same
a	572	0	in 2016 it was only 85.57 and that isn't too far from 1962 and that was only 85.10 there is only 47-degree difference
a	634	0	because in the 1990s there was maybe half 84 and half 85 but in the 2000s it is  more 84 than 85 I sorted it by year so I could see the difrence between years in order I just checked if it was not just the 2000s they were talking about but it did not matter.
a	432	0	I know why it would be true, because Where it says claim two,  it says that its decreasing.
a	305	1	The lower the temperature is, the slower the life cycle goes.
