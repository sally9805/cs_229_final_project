a	698	0	I think its false because of global warming. Global warming would actualy make the geat go up.
a	361	0	I think this claim is false because the populatoin has not stayed the same, this is because as the years increase the butterfly number increases to.for example in 1996 there were 33.50 million and fast forward to 2003 there were 556.00 and it just keeps droping and soon there will be no butterflies.
a	475	0	In 2013, the population was 33.50 million, but in 1998, it was almost 30 times that! Not much more to say.
a	24	1	The graph provided with the investigation shows that commonly the higher temperature sands normally have hatching female turtles unlike hatching male turtles that do their thing in colder sands. Now in the graph, some male turtles hatch in warmer sands than female hatching turtles but not as often as the other way around. I still stick with my decision with true with my reasons conveniently said and the graph for evidence
a	520	1	The highest count of butterfly was in 1996 and ever since then it has dropped rapidly over the past 17 years. And it has dropped by over 800 million, so it has not been staying the same.
a	536	1	in 1960 the temperature was 84.56, but in 2016 the temperature is 85.57. it is going just a little higher
a	669	1	this fact is false because as i move down the data chart from beginning to end it starts at 33.50 and goes to 909.50 the count of butterfly's in Mexico have gone way up.
a	122	0	The reason why is because heat can change how will it gose thought it's cycle because it can shevle up and it could die in the cold due to the tempture drop.
a	187	0	I believe that the sand temperature affects whether the leather back eggs hatch as a fem. or male.Because in the article it said that scientist sometimes collect the eggs and control the temp. and then check if they are a fem. or male.
a	693	0	86.72 it hier than 85.21\n\n\n\n   86.72=2020 .     85.21=2008
a	273	1	The data shows that in higher temperatures females are normally hatched.  In lower temperatures male are normally hatched.
a	673	0	When I sorted the data by year(lowest to highest), I found that the amount has increased and then decreased through the years. It has not stay really stayed the same.
a	467	0	The temperature seems to go up and down each year. It isn't exactly decreasing, but it does go down a tiny bit each year. But then it will rise again, being back to the temperature it was before. I believe it's partly true, but the temperature rises again in a few years,
a	232	1	Some males where  born in hot tempture same as females. It goes back and forth to say the heat affects the gender, if you say that  the hotter sand has females you would probly wrong  next time some males where born in high tempture  thats why its probly false.
a	376	0	The temperature has been mostly the same when you look at the data, so obviously, it wouldn't be decreasing over the years.
a	323	1	I think this is partly true and partly false because their is one section where the graph doesn't support the claim of sand temperature effecting the gender. The graph also shows that the claim cant be fully false.
a	593	1	as the years go by they get lesser and lesser from 909 million to 33 million
a	334	0	i think that this is false because when the temptures are higher it take longer and most people would think that it would go faster because there is more food.
a	325	0	of you look at sort by Temperature high to low you will find that if it 85 degreas and up it will be a female and 84 degreas and lower is mail.
a	603	0	because each year more go to Mexico because it's warm in Mexico.
a	180	1	I think true because if a monarch butterfly's habitat is cold then it  will not be able to transfer throw out all of the other stages in its life cycle, but if a monarch butterfly's habitat is warm then it will be able to transfer throw the stages. Just like if a human goes out side in the cold then the fluids inside of your body will not stay warm, but if you are inside and it is warm inside then the fluids in your body will keep running faster throw out your body.
a	284	1	Well, when I sorted the data by temperature lowest to highest, I looked at the life cycle stages and first there were a chunk of caterpillar  and then chrysalis  then more caterpillars back and fourth. I think that if the claim was true then all the caterpillars would be together and all the chrysalis would be together.
a	620	0	on my graph is doesn't look like the population is the same because it keeps going up and down not a steady amount each year
a	680	0	If you sort it by year you will see that it achuly got two digreas warmer.
a	253	0	All of the facts that were included in this text had great details. I think temperature does effect how fast the monarchs go through their life cycle. I think this because if they get to cold when they are in their chrysalis they can freeze on the inside and not grow. Also, if it is too hot for the caterpillar in it's chrysalis it would probably kill them and cause them to not grow anymore.
a	543	0	because this is dumb and I don't want to do it, and so Im not going to try. and also the temperatur is literally changed by 1 degree !!!!!!!!
a	49	0	is all way hot on a iland so they have t o udapt to the heat and there in the sand so the egg are cept cold
a	678	0	I believe the claim is false because in my graph the temperature has shown increase from the year 1960.
a	595	0	because all the year I saw were all different yes. but, one of the things it showed that in 2002 86.72 for the heat in ('F). it shows that in 1994 in was 85.57  for the heat in ('F.
a	159	0	if the sand is hot it will eafeck the eggs
a	540	0	The count in millions has changed a lot\n
a	21	0	I believe that the temperature can maybe change if it is a male or female, but I don't really know.  Some of the results say record that there were 4 males or females in a row at the same place wich there temperatures would be different in different places, but they also show in some sections that they can be scattered (one female one day a male a different day). But on the other hand, a female lays there eggs all together in the same place under the sand so the temperature would be very close in the same hole and there are different genders in one hole.  So I think that it can be true or false.
a	182	0	I think its false because male and female turtles were being born in 85 degrees.The same goes for 84 degrees.
a	34	0	I think its wrong because there are similar temperatures and some die as a caterpillar and some die in a chrysalis. for example, there is one where it's 60.90 and it dies as a caterpillar then there's one where its 60.98 and it dies as a chrysalis.
a	401	1	when you go to the 1960 the temps were 84 and when you go to dates higher up you see the actually increase
a	377	0	i dont know\n
a	299	1	I think this claim is true because, when I organized the data by temperature, I saw some patterns. First, when the eggs were in the 54 - 59.36 degree range, they were all caterpillars. Second, when the eggs were in the 59.37 - 60.90 degree range, they were a mixture of caterpillars and chrysalises. Lastly, when the eggs were in the 60.91 - 64 degree range, they were all chrysalises. That is why I think the claim is true. The temperature of a monarch butterfly's habitat does affect how quickly it goes through its life cycle stages.
a	85	1	I think its true because if you look at the data on the chart you can see that male turtles are hatched when the sand temperature is 85.04 and below and the females temperature is  is 85.04 and higher.
a	123	0	the temperature does not seem to affect the butterfly's life cycle.
a	44	0	i thin that is true becaus that is wat the data said and thats the srcul of life for a buter fliy
a	57	0	because if it is cold the babies will die
a	279	1	One reason why I think that is partly true partly false is if that were true then either 1 or 25 would NOT be the same gender as they are because number 1 (85.80) is only .61 hotter than 25 (85.19). I think it is partly true to because the the data shows Females average 85 and a half maybe more and also shows the Males average 84 and a half so that is why I think that it is partly true and partly false.
a	19	0	ariana
a	397	0	the temperature of  the sand in raine island,Australia has been  decreasing since 1960.
a	286	1	the weather makes the monarch slow done if it is to cold out they stay as caterpillars and when it is hot they grow up faster.\n They grow faster if they eat more.\nthey grow slow if it is 61 to 54 farinhite\nmost of theyse are still caterpillars because it is still cold
a	476	1	I think false because, They been going down in the last few years. Also when it gose down also the year is too so this shows something to do with us! Thats why I think its False.
a	72	0	I think it's partly true and partly false because there are some caterpillars that have not became a chrysalis in the same temperature as the caterpillars that have already became chrysalis.
a	531	0	It is false because in 2002 it was 86.72 and in 2008 it was 15.21 but in 1964 it was 84.56\n
a	42	0	\nthe sands temperature in the ocean shore affects if  it will be a boy or a girl who will hatch from the   turtles egg.
a	3	1	because if it is could the cocoon is cold then it might freeze and when i am outside in the winter i do not see catpellar's  or butterfly's. In the summer i think it would be much qucker.
a	241	0	i think its false because it said that they hatch in the sand and go find safety in the sea they don't  say anything about having a special temature.
a	356	0	I think this clam is false, Because well I was reading it said that we have to keep estamating the range, Because more Monarch Butterfly's keep coming to the perfecht wether in Mexico to the forest.
a	38	0	it shows that really no matter what temp it is that any male or female can hatch
a	646	0	I think this claim is false because there is a lot of variety each year. for example in 2009 there were 96 million butterflies and in 2010 there were 201 million butterflies.
a	381	0	idk brynn brynn brynn brynn brynn brynn brynn brynn brynn brynn brynn brynn brynn brynn
a	462	0	It goes down and goes up\n
a	442	0	Yes, because if you look at the temperature it is going down and down more.
a	504	0	I don't think the temperature of the sand in Raine Island has been decreasing because in the data it shows that the sand temperature from 1960 all the way up to 2012 has been in a five degree radious from eachother.
a	166	1	i think is is true because the lowest for males to spawn is 80.60 temp and the lowest for females is 84.20 temp so the hotter the sand it will be a female the colder the sand is it going to be a male and that's why the sand temperature affects if it's a male or female
a	499	0	because over the years the count of butterfly's in mexico had increased and decreased alot
a	677	0	In my graph since the year 1993 it has rapidly increased, rapidly decreased, and mediocrity decreased. Which is the exact opposite of the scientists claims.
a	631	0	the monarch population staying the same is false because looking at my data, the numbers are nowhere near eachother
a	47	0	I think it is false because if an egg is laying playa sand it can come out as a female or male because if you look at the chart and look at what gender is next to playa sand it will say either female or male, not just male, not not just female. Same to do with the Suriname sand.
a	14	0	i dont know addy addy addy addy and bestfriends are brynn tyler maddys erin sabree dill pickle sammy myself my sleep peralisis demond
a	509	0	I think it is partly true because butterflys can stay the same but not that long. I also know that mexico has alot of butterflys.
a	388	0	the change in weather can happen
a	144	0	because if its to cold it might freeze, killing the butterfly, and if its to warm or hot it could die of exhaustion or it could over-heat causing the stages of a butterfly to slow down.
a	426	0	Because the numbres on the chart.
a	465	1	The count overall got smaller.
a	301	1	The higher temperature are mostly female and the lower temperature are mostly male. I said partly true partly false because some male sea turtles are high temperatures and some female sea turtles are in the lower temperatures.
a	613	0	I looked  at the smallest tempshore and it is 2002 Wich i found helpfullbeculs  IT means it is NOT decreasing if 1960 is only 8456
a	183	0	hi my name is ................
a	296	1	I think it is true because male eggs like the sand cooler then female eggs like the sand .The male eggs like 80 to 85 degrees and female like it 84 to 88 degrees.
a	519	0	I think its partly true because some of the years the temperature is colder than the other years 2002 is warmer then 2008 and 2010 because they are colder then the later years.
a	342	1	I think this claim is true because when the temperature rises, there seem to be more females. between 84.20-85.19 it is kinda scattered but in general, it seems like the lower the temp. the more males, but the higher the temp. the more females. since this claim doesn't go into many specifics, I think we could say yes, the sand temperature affects the gender of the turtles.
a	565	1	In 1960 Temperature was 84.56 and in 2016 the Temperature was 85.57 so it increased.
a	220	1	The caterpillars all went into their pupas when the temperature was 59 degrees (F) or higher.
a	226	0	Because it shows inside and outside and two are both caterpillars but then also one is a chrysalis. That is the same tempachure so kinda true kinda false
a	150	0	I think it is true because if it is cold it is harder for them to turn into a butterfly because it is so cold outside. Another example is if it is really hot outside then it would be hard for the crystal to change because it is so hot.
a	558	0	They have not stayed the same since scientists started keeping track. They actually have decreased by over 300 million the first year and then over 20 million the last year
a	307	0	I think the first claim is partly right and partly wrong because if you look at the data close enough you will see that the highest temperature is 63.14 and the life cycle stage is a chrysalis and as the temperature goes down you see that the life cycle stage has changed into a caterpillar so the life cycle of stage of the butterflies is taking a bit longer.
a	619	0	that is not true because some numbers were is the 900s and some were only in the 100s so it was all mixed up so i would not say it was about the same.
a	93	0	because some times its colder than other times and its still the same part of the cycle\n
a	665	0	I said it is false because when I looked at the data as the year went higher the temperature moving up. For example, in 1960 the temperature was 84 degrees and in 2014 it was 86 degrees.
a	547	0	Yes it has because it's been at a constant migration of the protest of the change of the butterfly started at 2020 to 1996.
a	147	1	higher the tempeature the more females hatched
a	98	1	In Playa most of the females sand temperature is higher than the males sand temperature. Like number 1 Playa 85.80 was a female. then number 8 at Playa 80.67 was a male. So it must make a difference if the temperature of the sand is high or low because almost all of the lower ones are male and most of the higher ones are female.
a	11	0	I think its true because in colder weathers, monarch butterflies usually go inside where it warmer but when  monarch butterflies are in warmer weather they tend to go outside because it would be way warmer than the colder times.
a	526	0	because in 1960 the sand temperature was 84.56 and in and in 1972 it was 84.20
a	522	0	The temperatures have not been decreasing they have been staying around 85 degrees the coldest its been there is 84 degrees.
a	653	0	If you look at the chart the year 1960 is lowest but then it is increasing not decreasing so I think that claim 2 is false.
a	120	0	The data shows the caterpillars are turning into chrysalis at certain temperatures without supplying anymore info. How much did they eat? What did they eat? Where did they live? When did they eat? Were they sick? There's a lot more that we would need to know in order to tell. There are indoor caterpillars that turned in to chrysalis, but outdoor caterpillars, too. For all we know, the outdoor ones could be more productive out in the wild, and the indoor ones may just be fed and lazy.
a	406	1	I think this statement is false because butterflies dies in a quick amount of time they don't stay around for 17 years and the data on the chart has different numbers leading up to 2013 as you can see it has gone down.
a	446	0	this is boring
a	335	1	I think this question is true because when the temperatures are getting warmer there are lots of chrysalis'. But when it is a little colder out there are mostly caterpillars.
a	218	0	because the butterfly has to go places
a	114	0	because if the temperature change  will efeck\nit and it will not think it is clam.
a	261	0	I think it's true because, I think that when it's hot the chrysalis is more likly to be wanting to get out of the chrysalis. The butter fly could also be wanting to dry it's wings on the sun ( because it's hot.)
a	264	0	I think the temperature affects the monarch butterfly because when i changed the temperature to highest to lowest i saw that in the 60s i saw that they were all mostly chrysalis and when the the temperature is lower they are caterpiler.
a	193	0	its false because we don't have enough information.
a	78	0	?
a	672	0	I know that this claim is false. I know this because the temperature is barley changing. Over all the temperature is increasing rather than decreasing. This claim is opposite from the truth.
a	146	0	The temperature of the sand shouldn't affect the eggs because when you look at your data table you can see there is no clear pattern for the temperatures to prove that there is a way for the temperature to affect whether leatherback eggs are hatch as male or female.
a	420	1	when i sorter the years i  the new one is the hottest with 85.57 and the last is 84.56
a	348	0	how it migerates it changes treaw the wind
a	148	0	i think its true because the temperature affects whether leatherback eggs hack then they will die
a	219	1	As I quickly looked through the location, and went onto temperature where I looked and saw that mainly the monarch butterfly does turn into the chrysalis quicker at hotter temperatures whether inside or outside.
a	431	0	because there are no data that the monarch butterfly has stayed in one place for many times in a row. it did not come back in 2013 but they did come back in 2014. so it is false they did not stay in on place for a whily\n
a	58	1	When the temperature is higher its seems to male it slower because all of the chrysalis is 59 degrees or above and all of the caterpillars are 60 degrees and under. The chrysalis stage comes first and is all a higher temp than the caterpillars stage is after the chrysalis stage and is a lowe temp.
a	36	0	because the  evidence shows that the temperature is in the 80s so the sand has to be in the 80s to be hatched
a	4	1	I think the claim is true because outside it is 56.84 degrees  and the butterfly is in the caterpillar stage. The other one says that it is 59.54 degrees and the butterfly in in it's chrysallis stage.
a	469	0	in mexioco the count of marnark buttr flys stay the same because it is always worm there\n
a	699	0	It is true because when I put the years from lowest to highest so that is why I think it is true.
a	552	0	well some years it was decressing and some years it was getting hotter so i dont know if thats a true fact that ever sence 1960 the sand temp has been decreasing
a	319	0	when i sorted the temperatures from lowest to highest it the males and females were mixed up. so i think that this would be partly true partly false
a	577	0	it canged a lot and they were in all kinds of places
a	92	1	The females are usually hotter.
a	555	0	they leev for winter
a	589	0	if you see the evidence you see that the first 2002 thing is 86.72 degrees but in the 2012 one it is 85.06
a	54	1	I think that it partially matters what temperature it is for a monarch butterfly to effect how fast it's life cycle goes because when i was looking at the data i noticed that if the temperature was over or at 60.48 then it was more likely to be in a chrysalis.
a	505	0	I think that it is true because they say every winter they migrate Mexico and they estimate the butterfly population every year sense 1993.
a	29	1	In the graph, you can see many of the females were found in Playa and many of the males in Suriname. The temperature for the females is mostly high ranging from 88-84. From this, we can make the claim that females spawn in warmer climates. As the males spawn in cooler areas.
a	537	0	i think this claim is false because in the 1962 the temperature was 85.10 degrees and in 2012 was 85.06. the temperature has only dropped 0.6 degrees in 52 years.
a	470	1	As you can see in the data...over the years the butterfly population in Mexico has changed. There were way more butterflies in the 90's. in the 2000's the numbers died down , but in the early and late 2010's it slowly started rising again.
a	75	0	yes because 50 50
a	73	0	butterfly's like the warmness but it does not help them grow does the warmness help us grow we like it like butterfly's it does not help us grow.
a	25	0	Most of the monarchs are still caterpillars because it takes a long time to create a chrysalis,and since it takes long to make a chrysalis it is partly true.But if we did the same but with only chrysalis we will see that its just in the middle.
a	209	1	i think its partly true and partly false because number 1 and  2 are both 85 degrees and one is male and ones female but numbers 19 and 20 is a big different 19 is 80 degrees and its a male and 20 is 86 degrees and a female
a	535	0	the
a	466	0	it will stay the same because it is warm\n all year around
a	312	1	I think that wen it gets hoter it seams that the speasheas gros faster as you see in the graf.
a	184	1	all of the chrysalis are 60 or above and all of the caterpillar are below 59
a	181	1	I believe that the female are born in the higher temperature than the males. The numbers on the board for females the highest is 87.09 for for the temp, but for the boys it's like 83.62 for the temp.
a	101	1	All higher temperatures above 59.50 are in stage 3 or 4 because of how high the temperature is in there location. But just 6 of them are still in stage 2 though.I have thought about it and came up with this theory, they may have been born just went the temperature was warmer and they still are growing fast but just have not made the cut.
a	200	0	it taks abowt a yere
a	461	0	it might of been decreasing because of the weather
a	617	0	When we look at the  year, then at the temperature, we can see that in 1960 the temperature was high, but it said that the temperature in Raine Island was decreasing, which means that it was going down.
a	201	1	well most females in the data are born in 85.50 degrees  or more and most males are born below 85.50 degrees. all but 2 females are bore in less 80.50 degrees. and there not 1 male is born in more that 80.50. so its not exactly true but it is party true
a	527	0	I think this claim is wrong because in 1993 the population of monarch butterflies were at 311.50 million. But by 2003, the population has risen to 556.00 million. And by 2018 it went back down to 302.50. This is why I think the claim is false.
a	132	0	if you look at 1,2,and 3 the first is female and the temperature is at 85.80 and then the second one is male the temperature for that one is 85.04 but if you look at the third its female but the temperature is 84.77 which is colder than the males
a	192	0	It's True because it is the same thing but their are a little diference. They almost have the same patterns.
a	6	0	I think this claim is partly true partly false because it has to be a certain temperture for a cryselis to form.
a	393	1	well in 1960 the temp was 84.56 and in 2016 the temp was 85.16 witch is higher but the temp did drop some years but it has clearly gone up
a	260	0	I think sand temperature affects leatherbacks so they hatch as male or female. Temperature from as low as 84.20 to as hi as 88.08. Males are as low as 80.60 and as hi as 85.19.
a	326	0	If you look at number 26 the temperature is 63.14 and the butterfly is in its chrysalis but if you look at number 29 the butterfly is a caterpillar
a	210	0	If you look at the data you will see the data I highlighted their is a Temperature the same and they are Male and Female.
a	263	0	I think the temperature affects the monarch butterfly because when i changed the temperature to highest to lowest i saw that in the 60s i saw that they were all mostly chrysalis and when the the temperature is lower they are caterpiler.
a	16	0	I think it's partly true because it shows that inside they are mostly still chrysalis and outside its more of caterpillars
a	480	0	In my graph, the dots representing the number of butterflies are scattered all over the place, definitely not the same. This proves that the claim is false.
a	231	1	when outside it  chrysalis's faster and it's warmer outside
a	83	0	I think this is true because if it is super cold outside the butter fly will be very cold and might freeze to death.  But if it is to hot the butter fly might die of heat.
a	266	0	some of the chrysalis are at the 56 degree mark but most of them are from 60 to
a	149	0	I think it is false because the turtle born in Playa for example is a female that was born at a temperature of 85.80 degrees Fahrenheit and one of the males born in Playa is 84.98. There is also males, and females born in Suriname that are almost exactly the same temperature when they were born. In conclusion that is why i think that The sand temperature doesn't affect whether leatherback eggs hatch as a male or female.   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\np
a	594	0	in 2013 there were 33.50 million and in 1996 there was 909.50 million and that is an 876 million difference.
a	23	0	The temperatures are not that different. They are all in the high 50s/low 60s. The majority is the caterpillar even though the temperatures at least 1 degree apart. But then again a few degrees can make a difference depending on the study.
a	87	1	True, because if the sand is cool then it is a male, but if the sand is hot then it is a female.
a	109	1	84.20 and up is allmost all female
a	473	0	as you see the years to 1960 to 2016 the 1960 is at 84.56\nbut the 2016 is at 85.57 so it is false\n
a	633	0	Looking at my data I desided that I would make it into a graph. \nThen I set the Y axis to sample number and X axis to year then I added a trend line and saw the data going down hugely. It went from 909.50 to 33.50.
a	350	0	if its cold or if its a bigger egg it will hatch more slow if its a bigger or more cold cattipiler will stay in to keep worm
a	524	0	i think this claim is false because This table jumps from 556.00 million to 109.50 million
a	94	0	Most eggs don't hatch with warm weather but they also can hatch themselves.\n
a	344	0	It is true because the temp. is just like the other female temp. so that is why I think it is true.
a	463	0	I think the numbers change depending like how much food they\neat or the tempature or the breeding.
a	125	1	If you look at the temperatures from lowest to highest, you see that all the lowest temperatures say caterpillar and the higher temperatures say chrysalis. This shows that the temperature of the habitat affects how quickly monarch butterfly's life cycle stages change.
a	434	0	in many years there's proof of temperature rising an decreasing back and forth.
a	479	0	it has been decreasing but not very fast.
a	41	0	i dont now
a	553	0	Becuse I think that sand can not be wash away from the bech the humens
a	571	1	I think it is not true because it side it was decreasing when it has been going up for the most part it only goes down a littal bit!
a	602	1	When you look at the chart pay attention to the numbers of the population. It was going downward! In 1993 the population was 3 million to 1996, 9 million now look at 2013, 33 million! It was in the hundred million not 10 million! You can not say it has stayed the same when it fell down to 10 million. I think the claim is False!
a	507	1	the temp is incresing
a	269	1	I think the claim is true because the graph shows that the highest temperature shows that the catupiler is in its chrysalis the coldest temperature the butterfly was still a catipiller.
a	276	1	I know the temperature of the monarch butterfly's habitat affects how quickly it goes through its life cycle stages is because when I sort the data by cold to hot and most of the hot temperature was the chrysalis meaning they do better in hot places
a	258	0	I think that the  sand tempechure WONT change wether  a sea tuttle haches a boy or girl. Becauls i looked at the data tabelle and saw that mostly  regardles of the  temechure ita an even chance.
a	346	0	so the temp. helps but not to hot
a	630	0	Sample one has 33.50 million buterflies.Sample number 8 has 145.50. The numbers go higher every sample number.
a	272	1	I found that the butterflies grow more in warmer weather.   The butterflies in 54 degrees were still in the caterpillar stage.  But in the 62 degree range they were in the chrysalis stage.  That shows they grew more.
a	486	0	Because more and more butterflies come there each year.
a	332	1	When the temperature is higher the butterfly is turning into a chrysalis and soon the chrysalis is turning into a monarch butterfly.
a	489	0	This is hipping because of the forest fires and polotchipon\nthat has been happening for years
a	151	1	all the females are at a higher tem like 85 butt the males are lower like 80 but some males are at 85 too and some females are as low as 84
a	295	1	i think this claim is true because when the temperature  is warmer most of the butterflies stay inside. When, the temperature is colder most of them stay outside to make there chrysalis.
a	403	1	Some are saying that the temperature of the sand in Raine Island, Australia has been decreasing since 1960. This information is incorrect. As I have made my graph of data that has been collected from the past years, I have found that the temperatures have gone up since 1960, not gone down.
a	197	0	I don't think it really matters were they are born or what temp it is they will be any gender really think suriname has more boys than girl and playa has more girls than boys.
a	528	0	They when to know how the lefe sikole goses so they keep track of the butterflys.
a	501	0	I think this is true because the data table shows that the temperature was decreasing lower and lower each time they tested it.
a	694	0	yes because i looked at the map type thing and if i'm right it shows the population of the monarch butterfly.the map gives me a good way of seeing the population and im going with that the population is the same now than it was.
a	422	0	no because it goes from 85.21 to 86.72 also it keeps going from 84 to 85.
a	365	1	Why I think it is false is pretty simple. If you look at the table or digram then it shows in 1960 the temputare of the sand was 84.56 degrees F. And then go 2014 the temputuare is 86.16 degrees F. So that would lead me to believe that the temputuare of the sand is increasing not decreasing.
a	482	0	The weather is not going down. I know that because in 2002 it was just about the same tempature as it was in 2012.
a	437	0	The graph shows that the temps of the sand have decrease but in some years they got higher.
a	246	0	I think it is not eftine becaues it do not say that it is
a	205	1	when the temperature is lower most of the butterflys are still caterpillers and when the temperature is higher most of the butterflys are chrysalis
a	317	0	I know the claim is partly true and partly false. I know this because The hot sand produces females and cold sand produces male turtles. the partly part is because in the middle of the graph, it's a mix of male, and female babies. I sorted it this way because the question was on the temperature of sand.
a	222	0	because the report showd that the tempiture dosent realy matter
a	262	0	If you put the temperature from lowest to highest and look at the male/  female collem, the low temperature is female, and the male is in the high temperature.
a	107	0	Cause the type of turtles only hatch as males
a	562	0	The temp goes up by a degre and then one year it will go down by a degre.
a	352	0	it dose not mater.
a	40	0	sample #7 is almost the exact same tep as #60
a	435	0	Because mexico can not stay the same it haves to change at some point that's what I think.
a	500	0	I think is true its because the monarch butterflies like it warn in Mexico.
a	625	0	in 1960 it was 84.56 (f) then in 2016 it was 85.57 (f). that is why.
a	379	0	I think the scientists are wrong the sands are not going down in temperature and the graph provides the evidence to support. Yes by the graph the sands go up and down every recorded time like it can go up then it can go down then back up then down but the last one is back up which supports my stupid claim\n
a	33	1	because in the hotter temperature the female eggs hatched
a	368	0	every time in two years the temperature was in between 84-86
a	605	0	because it was in the reading!!!!!
a	390	0	False because on the graph the numbers change depending on the years. because 1996 the butterfly rate was really hi and in 2013 it was really low.
a	196	0	dot no\n
a	95	0	because it starts from caterpillar to chrysalis, then it ends with a caterpillar not a butterfly.
a	303	0	I think it is partly true partly false, its partly true because i realize that female baby turtles are born with higher tempatures and males are born with lower tempatures, and I can understand that. But I also think its partly false because number 2 (male) has 85.04, and number 28 (female) has a tempature in the range of 84, so does number 3 and number 9. Im a little confused of what this means and I think that if females are born in that area, the should be males.
a	616	0	I think this claim is false because, when you look at the graph, the count is not the same, in the years. In 1997, this is the most of the butter flys had been there.(in Mexico.)
a	645	1	I think it is false because the graph shows that it is increasing insted of decreasing.\n
a	450	0	because it went from 33.50 to 909.50.
a	82	1	Because some male temps are low that means that females are high temps. But some males are quite high in temps.
a	91	0	BECASE IM HOMEAFOBIC AND I HATE TRANSEGENDER
a	660	0	Each year there's a little bit of a difference and sometimes it stays the same. In 1993 when scientists started estimating butterfly population the population was about 311.50 and the lowest one was in 2013 and it was 33.50.
a	554	0	I think this claim is true because if the temp changes out side the sand changes.
a	371	0	This is true because
a	195	1	The lower temperature they are in the caterpillar stage and in the higher temperature they are in a chrysalis stage.
a	449	0	The reason why I think it is false is because it can't be true.\n
a	563	0	I think it is partly true partly false because some butter flys were made from the cacoon and sme had to die off so i dont know if it is true or false.\n
a	358	0	because some butterfly's moved to other places in the world they did not just stay in one place.
a	173	0	I think that  it is partly Fales cuz it lakes a long time to              \nbecome a butterfly..
a	198	0	I think the terteles are lether back becuse there are diferet to other  tipes of anamules
a	270	1	the males are at the bottom and some in the middle, the females are at the top there are three in the middle. Also it said in the beginning that the temperature determines if they are male or female.
a	658	0	I think that this piece of evidence is partly true partly false too, because the island off of Australia is getting warmer but I also notice that its not, in 2002 the tempature was 86.72, but in 2010,12,and 16 the tempature was in the 85's, So it went down. Plus, it's just an island off of Australia. That doesn't mean that the whole country is having there tempature increasing.
a	221	1	when the temature became hotter and more dense the buterfly started going through the cycles of their transformation
a	137	1	when it was cold outside they were mostly still caterpillars. I also saw that some of them were inside witch I think has effected how they grew to be butterflies because it was warmer inside then outside some days,  I think that may of effected how they grew.
a	214	0	the go thro stoages and the wintr thay are thry millen miols from thay nachrol habtat
a	624	0	in 2018 there was 302 and in 1995 there where 630 and in 1996 there was 909 and in 2013 there was 33 so I think that that claim is false.
a	234	0	because for some reason the heat makes the gender different and the turtles know this so they place their eggs in different places accordingly.
a	106	0	sometimes it might be harder to lay eggs and give birth in colder-weather because it might hurt
a	59	0	The temperatures of a monarch butterfly's can affect the life cycle because for example, the intense heat may interfere with butterfly's natural habitat and life cycle changes and can put heat on monarch butterfly's life cycle by shutting down their organs, or maybe slowing down the process of growing.
a	474	0	because the heat goes upbut it also goes low\n
a	230	0	it's partly true and partly false because maybe the sand temperature does affect whether leatherback eggs to hatch as male or female but it could be false because it depends on the gender who knows if the sand temperature affects the animal's gender
a	419	1	I think this claim is partly true and false because the monarch count has stayed in the millions but the numbers have increasingly have gone way lower sense 1996.
a	534	0	Out of time
a	493	1	In the data if we take the oldest date and the newest date, we will see that the water is accutaully is incressing.
a	129	0	it does not madder about the weather. It just madders what the turtle gave birth to in the eggs.
a	684	0	I think that this claim is false because in the graph  made it shows that it did go down on the third year but then it started to increase sense then and it does not seem like it is going down any where.
a	0	0	Female or Male they go to warm places where temperature go up to 80 degrees. They always go to warmer places
a	349	0	because they just don't just lay girl turtle
a	143	1	I said what I said because of males where more cornily born in colder places
a	452	0	because they go to mexico in winter
a	682	0	in 2008 the temperature is 85.21 but in 2002 the temperature is 86.72
a	599	1	yes because of its tempura is raising.
a	255	1	After 11 days there were more chrysalises when it was warmer and more caterpillars as it got colder. So warmer temps make the monarch butterfly's life cycle go faster.
a	448	1	because its going down evrey year
a	90	0	i dont know
a	293	0	If you look at the table you will see that if it is most likely to be warm the turtle will be a female. Because I looked at all of the temperature and the temp is high if it is a female. If the temperature is on the cooler side then that means that the turtle will be a male. All of the temperatures that show males have a lower temperature than the females. And females have a higher temperature than the males. So I think when it is warmer it will be a female and when it is cooler it will be a male.
a	695	0	I think that the sand temperature in Raine Island has not been decreasing since 1960 because the temperature numbers have just kind of been scattered around after I organized the data by year.
a	69	1	when the caterpiler is in his chrysalis stage it is hoter but when it is in its normal stage it is ushiy less worm [NOTE: grayed out rows already coded in Feb13 file]
a	76	0	i think it is true because it said on one that it is a caterpillar and it was 56.84 (F) but then when it was in a chsalar so the wather sangis all the time so the caterpillar is in all cinds of wether.
a	112	1	The temperature for male eggs was between 80-86, which is lower than the 84-87 that the female eggs had. I believe that if the egg is warmer, females will hatch. If it's colder, males will hatch.
a	643	1	I think it is false. So look at the chart at 1960 the temperature is 84.56 but almost every year after that it has been 85 or 86 but some have been 84 but most are higher on 84. But on 1964,1970 and 1972 are all lower but it said that it has been decreasing since 1960 which means every year after that but way more are higher plus the last year is 85.57 which is also higher.
a	638	1	I think this claim is false because at 1960 it was 84.56. But if you look at my evidence two years after it was 85.10. Through the years the temperature has been getting higher and is not decreasing. Also the temperature got up to 86.72 which has not decreased from 1960. So the temperature of the sand in Raine Island is not decreasing.
a	415	0	on the chart it shows that the temperature has decreased and in crested over time making this evidence true
a	661	0	It is false because the sand temperature keeps on going to 84 to 85. It starts at 84 then went up to 85 in 2016 so it's going up and not down.
a	283	1	I think this claim is partly true and partly false. I think this because if you look at the males most of them have lower temperatures than the females. Most males are 85 to 80 for their temperatures. As you see most females are 85 and up. But some males are higher than 85 and some females are lower than 85. But as you see most females are higher than 85 and most males are lower than 85.
a	314	1	up high has mostly chrysalis and down below is all catapilar starting at sample number 3, inside, 59.36 degrees. however there are a few catapilars up above too.
a	576	0	throughout most of the early 2000 the count of buterflies stayed realitivly the same only changing slightly fro 200 million to 500 million
a	491	0	If your looking at the chart, all the temperatures are around 83,85, and 84. Which means they haven't been decreasing at all.
a	472	1	If you look at the years under the year 2000 they have all smaller temperatures than the sand in the 2000's. So that means that the temperature increased actually.
a	119	0	i think that because they can both be man or femal
a	628	0	The temperature has been increasing not decreasing. The graph helps me see that.
a	704	0	because it is warm water
a	464	1	if anything the temperature has bean going up in stead of down because if you look is gose from 84.56 all the way to 85.57\n
a	641	0	In 1996 there were 909.50 mil butterflies. But in 2013 there were 33.50 mill and that is not a lot.
a	247	0	Usually, a caterpillar needs its time to hatch into a butterfly. That's why\nthey try to find the best place in a warm and slightly cold place like California and Mexico. If you don't know. On Day 11 the Chrysalis did not hatch faster or slower. It usually stays outside more than inside
a	523	0	the tempocher stead the same
a	441	0	i dont know
a	414	1	The monarch butterfly population has decreased by millions. The amount in 1996 909.50, to 2013 33.50. That was a HUGE decrease in population. I should have their job because I even know that.
a	654	0	
a	375	0	becues
a	679	0	If you sort it by year you will see that it achuly got two digreas warmer.
a	496	0	I think it is not changing because they are all different and all over the place with the temperature\n
a	652	0	I think claim 2 is false because the population is going up a lot and is almost up to 1000 so i so not think claim 2 is telling the truth.
a	336	0	i think that it is incstre but false\n
a	89	0	I think this claim is true because in Playa the temperature is 85.80 and the turtle is a Female and in Playa the temperature is 80.67 and the turtle is a Male.
a	52	0	I thinks it is true because a Leather back  can have male or female. some male and female have temper in there body that makes it feel warm or cold.
a	604	0	At 1998 first to number is getting lower just like what the claim #2 have say about that Raine Island, Australia, has been decreasing since 1960. but then the rest is the increasing then decreasing. I might actually not really know what their meanings are.
a	43	0	i think it is false because under the sand the temp is the same even when it is colder abouve ground\n
a	324	0	of you look at sort by Temperature high to low you will find that if it 85 degreas and up it will be a female and 84 degreas and lower is mail.
a	211	0	It's not about the sand tempature it's about if their genes are stronger and their genes dertermine what gender they are.
a	382	0	no they are not because other monarch butterfly are migrating there.
a	683	0	I think that this is false because the scientists are saying that that the population of the butterflies has been about the same in Mexico for the years that they have been counting then. I think that that is false because each year you can see that the population has been going up by millions over these past years. If you look at the evedence you can see that the population has gone way up. {By a LOT}
a	199	0	The sand temperature does not hove anything to do with if the leatherback being male or female.\n\n
a	111	1	if it is warm out it will change faster than if it is cold
a	275	0	sample ones temp is 56.84 and is a catapiller.sample twos temp is 59.54 and is a christallis.
a	546	0	It increses every year\n
a	202	0	if its to cold it will freeze to death and if its to warm its perfect temp for it to live
a	105	0	I think it is true because a turtle needs to feel comfortable when they are laying their eggs.
a	428	0	because more butterfly's have grown sense 1993 so the population has grown and grown sense then
a	412	0	IDK
a	362	0	I think its true because it depends on the weather.And if is hot or cold \n
a	320	1	The top of the Life Cycle Stage List where it is colder has all caterpillars and at the bottem of the list where it is hotter has a lot of chrysalis's \n\nI think that when it is warmer they go threw their stages faster and when it is colder they go threw their stages slower
a	649	0	If you look closely you will see that the temperature is also  increasing but as the year goes past the temperature is decreasing.It is doing both increasing and decreasing because if you look at the last two temperatures you will see that it will decrease but the very last one is increasing.
a	254	0	Partly false because I assorted the data table by temperature and some temperatures were the same but they had a different gender. Partly true because from 80-84 they were mostly only male turtles and just a few female turtles. Through 85-88 there was only female turtles.
a	404	1	i think it false because of climit chang it get hoter and hoter.
a	215	0	I think when the caterpillar is outside it will get very warm and when the caterpillar is inside it will cool off.
a	32	1	i believe that the sand can affect the gender some times because in the data that shows has the highest temperatures on top with the lowest on bottom and almost all of the high temps are female rather than male one of the highest temps is 88.08 and is female as well as 87.09, 86.97, 86.54, 86.26, those are the highest temps and they are all female the lowest temperature of the female in this test is 84.20 but most of the males is 83.31, 83.25, 82.45, 82.29, the highest of the males in this test is 85.19 quite low to the female turtles. I did say that this thought was partly true/partly false for these reasons
a	701	0	because the butterflys make hundreds of more butterflys
a	567	0	The data shows that in 1996 the population of the Monarch butterfly was 909.50 and in 2013 the population is 33.50 which shows a gigantic difference through 1996-2013.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n
a	285	1	The highest temparatures of sand are normally when females are born. The lowest tempatures are mostly male.
a	357	1	I think it is false because through the years the population has gone down 100's. For example the population has gone down 876.000 (876 hundredths), from 909.50 to only 33.50. So that is why I think that it is false.
a	456	0	It is true because from 1993 to 2018 it has stayed very close .The count is off by 9.00 million monarch butterflies.
a	61	0	i picked partly true and parly false because i feel like a butterfly starts asa catterpiller then grows to be a butterfly like other butterflys like ones we have in maine like the ones that come out in the summer and they have to have temperture thats not to hot or cold that is what i think\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\

a	8	1	Most of the chrysalis temperatures are 60 degrees and over plus maybe the temperatures have something to do with their migration because the text did say that they preffered lukewarm temperature
a	588	0	because it says that on the recording page and every year it gets lower
a	703	0	it is because the lay a baby evrey 1 mounth
a	140	0	Sea turtles are kinda the same as people. When they are born the heat doesn't change the gender. For ex: Sample number 3 and 16 They both have 84 as there temperature but one is female and one is male. It depends on if the father gave that egg the X or Y in the chromosomes.
a	690	0	"in 1996 the butterfly population in Mexico was 909.50 million. But scientists say that the population has always been about the same?! thats not possible. Because the earliest time they have so far is in 2018. and in 2018 there were only 302.50 million butterfly\'s. So i think the scientist who stated this is very off. 909.50 compared to 302.50 is a big difference, the butterfly population in Mexico has not ""stayed the same."""
a	343	0	I think that it's false, because there most likely  be a way for the sand does the turtles gender's.
a	691	0	the reson i think this is false is becuse maxco that not manicer come to  \nmain
a	153	0	The thing I just read said that the eggs can change but nothing about weather effects the turtle eggs.
a	458	0	becase\n
a	236	0	In the chart to the right in the outside with the crysalis is almost the exact same outiside with a catipillar
a	141	0	I think this is false because they are all different temperatures and one of the males temperature is 84.98 and a females is 84.20 so those are almost the same temperature so it does not matter.
a	175	0	I think that the tempature can affect how fast the butterfly goes through it's life cycles because you don't want the temperature to be too hot or too cold, so I think that the outside was perfect tempature because if it was too hot the butterfly would probably not be able to grow as fast but you would want kind of hot so a little hotter then warm. You don't really want it to be that cold for a butterfly because then it won't grow fast you barely want any cold.
a	697	0	I think this claim is false because as you can tell with the years sorted in this order, you can see how the temperatures go up, down, up, down.  I notest that toward the end in the parts the temp raised! I think it's safe to say this claim is false. on the chart, the green circle represents the temp dropping and the blue circle represents the temp rising. these are just two examples of this.
a	256	1	I think the sand temperature affects whether leatherback eggs hatch as a male or a female. I think that because on the data the warmest sand had mostly females and the cooler the sand got the more males there was. The warmest sand a male was hatched in was 85.19. The coolest a female egg hatched was 84.20. That is why sand temperature affects whether leatherback eggs are female or male.
a	46	1	when it is the warmer climates the eggs are female and when the climates are below 85  they are male
a	421	0	all the temperatures are reasonibly close to each other
a	579	0	the temp of the sand doesn't change
a	525	0	I think that this is false because they say the population stays the same but it doesn't. The population is more scattered than same.
a	411	1	I think that the temperature in the sand in Raine Island, Australia has NOT been decreasing since 1960, because in our data, the temperature is actually increasing instead of decreasing, for example in 1960, the temperature was 84.5 F, and in 2016, the temperature is up to 85.5.
a	685	0	I think its true because number 1 is 2002 its 86.72 and number 14 its 1968 its 83.75 its getting lower and I know Deccriceing means going down
a	670	1	on the chart, the temperature has gone not far down and pretty far up. i see that the temp has gone mostly up so it is not decreasing too much.
a	621	0	on my graph is doesn't look like the population is the same because it keeps going up and down not a steady amount each year
a	135	0	sometimes it did turn into a chrysalis, and sometimes it didn't. Iv'e heard that it depends how much food it has.
a	115	1	"For the first 2 data reports, both ""butterflies"" were outside. 2\'s butterfly was outside in warmer weather, and was a chrysalis already. 1\'s butterfly\'s was in a cooler weather than 2 so warmer weather does speed up the life cycle of a butterfly."
a	294	0	If you look at the table you will see that if it is most likely to be warm the turtle will be a female. Because I looked at all of the temperature and the temp is high if it is a female. If the temperature is on the cooler side then that means that the turtle will be a male. All of the temperatures that show males have a lower temperature than the females. And females have a higher temperature than the males. So I think when it is warmer it will be a female and when it is cooler it will be a male.

a	632	0	This answer is false because looking at the temperature range, it's staying in the same range from 1960 and up.\n
a	664	0	the population has moved around a lot because it has gone all the way from 33.50 to 909.50 and that is a big difference.
a	249	0	It says the sand temperature affects whether leatherback eggs hatch as male or female, but scientists figure out when they hatched.
a	267	0	some caterpiller's and chrysalis live in the same location and some are growing faster than others
a	560	0	this claim is false because in 1993 the count is about 311 million and in 2011 the count is about 144 million and that's a pretty big difference.
a	155	0	because some eggs need to be incubated and stuff and some dot so maybe the sand can cause it to not you hatch it can take longer
a	657	0	I think that this piece of evidence is partly true partly false too, because the island off of Australia is getting warmer but I also notice that its not, in 2002 the tempature was 86.72, but in 2010,12,and 16 the tempature was in the 85's, So it went down. Plus, it's just an island off of Australia. That doesn't mean that the whole country is having there tempature increasing.
a	162	0	I think it is true because if this butterfly went some where really cold then i think it would affect how quickly it goes through their stages.
a	311	1	Most of the chrysalis's are in warmer temps and most of the caterpillars are in cooler temps however, there are a noticeable amount of caterpillars in with  the chrysalis's.
a	640	0	I think that because the temperature goes higher and lower at all different years. For example, in 1960 the temperature of the sand was 84.56 and in 1962 the temperature was 85.10 which is higher then before.
a	18	0	The temperature changes the gender because when they are first laid they sea turtles are are not formed. The sea turtles are really undentified
a	637	1	I think this claim is false because as the years go on the temperatures are not staying about the same. Sometimes one year is millions more than the other. Through out the year it has gone up and down with less millions and more millions. So I believe this claim is false.
a	227	0	It is false because it never said anything about the temperature.  And it didn't say anything really about the male and female.
a	191	0	because it will still be in the 50 or 60 degrees if it is outside or inide
a	490	0	The number (in millions) goes up every year. that is NOT staying at around the same number.
a	62	1	females only hatch above 85 degrees and males hatch at 85 degrees and lower
a	399	0	i think thay can not fliy that fast to my grat thay are spostohibrnat in a ckon
a	584	0	I think its partly true and partly false because it could have changed it could have not changed
a	306	1	The higher the temperature is the higher the chance it's going to be a female. The lower the temperature is the higher  chance it has to be a Male leatherback.
a	696	0	it is going dowen then it goes up up up it decrest ones then got even better\n
a	542	0	I believe that the claim is false because on the chart in 1960 the temp.was 84.56 and the other years have had a lower temp.And other years the temp. has been higher.
a	189	0	"i don""t know"
a	251	1	I think its partly true/ partly false because in some parts it's colder than the warm temperature and it still said chrysalis.
a	627	0	I think this is false because the count goes from like 90 to 400 to 30.  On the graph it goes from 50 to 200 to 900.  900 is the most.  If it stayed the same most of the data would be in a line.
a	447	0	It has not been decreasing because it got higher.
a	549	0	Because the tempature has been gouing up and down since 1960-2016.
a	451	0	Since 1960 the temperature has bean in the 80's but it has bean going down but not by much at all
a	158	0	I think its only Party True / Partly False. I think this because if you look at the data you will see mainly in one locations its true about the claim but once you look at both you see that it's its not all true. Because for example #28 and #2 Work then if you look at another pair such as #22 and #26 it doesn't work in the slightest if you compare with the first example.
a	244	0	maybe it is because of  partly true/ partly False
a	9	0	I think it has to do with the turtle population.Because on top of the sand it was warm,But when you dig it gets colder because theirs no sun light but on the other hand when they get layed the ones more to the surface they have more light then others and it shows what is the temperature with is just the right to hatch in my option but the ones with less heat still might hatch that why i think it is partly true/partly false
a	598	0	because ofclimat change
a	233	0	because all female turtles lay their eggs on the beach and then she leaves them
a	88	0	they wod be dead of the temprchor.\n
a	136	1	If your looking at the chart, the females temperature is much higher than the males but, some of the temperatures are the same for both the genders. Thats why I think its partly true.
a	194	0	No because there are all diffrent types of temetures and they are both female and male so this claim is false. They all are 80 degres or over.
a	700	0	so they know what they are doing
a	124	1	I think it is true because in the data the lower temperature the more males and the higher temperature the more females.
a	433	0	?
a	568	1	It hasn't stayed about the same because if you look at the amount of butterflies in 1996 is higher and the number just keeps going down and down over the years.
a	274	0	sample ones temp is 56.84 and is a catapiller.sample twos temp is 59.54 and is a christallis.
a	235	1	wel the data proves the fact true in the evidence because the higher temp the life cycle proceeded quicker
a	128	0	i think it is true because if there cocoon is frozen then they can't be changing and there stages of becoming a butterfly.That's why i think the temperature matters in a butterfly's habitat.
a	1	0	I think this clam is true, Because in the story it says the Monarch Butterfly's temperature affects how quickly it goes through its life cycle stages.
a	37	1	I think this is fales because most of the higher the tepitures are still in the chrysallis stage
a	281	0	the importent info sayes the tempecher efects the gender.  its right because with my evedence it effects the turtles by gender.it also sayes that the temp efects the turtules in the story.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ns
a	156	0	Because it takes time for it to go through the stages. The temperature could change it maybe a little bit but not a lot for it to change how quick the stages go by.
a	172	1	I think this claim is true because when the monarch butterfly was outside and the temperature was at 56.84 it was only a caterpillar. But when a different monarch butterfly was also outside at a temperature of 59.54, it was already  in a chrysalis.
a	35	0	I believe that the temperature of the monarchs habitats does not depend on the monarchs habitat temperature. The reason that it doesn't depend on the  temperature is because the results vary between inside and outside of the temperature of the chrysalis. One of the temperature for the chrysalis is 59.54 Fahrenheit  and another is 63.14 Fahrenheit that is a 4 degree difference. Also the colder one is outside and  the hotter one is inside. That's why i Believe that the temperature does not matter for a monarch caterpillar to turn into a chrysalis.
a	22	0	i dont know
a	252	0	I think that the temperature efaces the cycle cus of the  temp difference of the caterpillar and the chrysalis
a	374	0	ariana
a	651	1	I made a graph to show whether the tempature has been decreasing or not and the graph showed me that the weather has been increasing. So, it is false the weather has not been decreasing
a	110	1	Every chrysalis tested had a temperature between 59 degrees and 63 degrees. The majority of  the chrysalises were inside.\nEvery caterpillar tested was between 54 and 60 degrees. Most caterpillars were outside. the locations for both were very close between more inside or more outside. Overall, I think it is partially true is because it is true, but the difference in temperature ranges was very small and might not mean anything. Also, the location may or may not have made a difference.
a	396	0	i dont now
a	313	1	I think that wen the sand is wormer the lether back trtals are more likly to be feamael becas the chart shows that in wormer temichers the tertals are feamale
a	164	0	I think its partly true and partly false because some of the male and females have almost the same exact temperature and some of them have lower or higher temperatures so it can be either gender depending on the coldness or the warmth of the sand or the eggs.

a	707	0	it is true.
a	117	1	I think this is true because if you look at the temperatures \n84 degrees and up are all females and if you look at the male temperatures they are all 86 and under.
a	130	1	Lots of the turtles that were raised in a cooler environment were males. A piece of evidence is from 80.60 to 83.85 are all males. The females are manly in the group with higher temperature. For example from 85.42 to 88.08 are all females.
a	17	0	vanessa
a	455	0	if anyting there over popualated
a	521	0	i think it is partly true and partly false because the temperature is dropping down and rising back up from the 1960 to the 2016
a	100	0	i don't know you tell me
a	516	1	The temperature was going up.
a	278	1	I am seeing that the life cycle IS affected by the temp. of their habitat.\nSome evidence that my claim is true is that 60 Degrees *f is when they start turning in to caterpillers but over 60 is chryalises.
a	139	1	because when in the higher temperatures the insect is mostly in the caterpillar stage and when it's in the lower temp they're mostly in the chrysalis stage but in some parts of the table that is not true.
a	503	0	i think true because in australia they have rain and sun some times and i think that would affect them in australia
a	271	1	When I was looking at the evidince, I noticed that all of the males were in sand of the temperature 85.19, and lower. all of the females were born at the temperature of 84.20 and higher. So to conclude the males are born at colder temperatures, and the females were born at slightly warmer temperatures.
a	439	1	because the butterfly count goes down a lot ever 1 to 2 years
a	176	0	because the numbers jump all over the place from high to low.So it seems like it dosent matter what tempature it is
a	557	0	So they don't over populate and have too much
a	416	0	i think it is true because it said people whached the butterfly so i think it is true if they said they whached the butterflyin mexico it has to be in the right temperture not to warm or to cold.\n
a	300	1	I think it's partly true/partly false because from the data outside is kind of warmer then inside and in the higher tempertures the monarchs are already at the chrysalis stage. In the article it said that monarchs move to warmer places in the winter. Places that are not to cold and not to warm. But I also think it is partly false too because looking at the data some monarchs that are inside are in chrysalis.
a	487	0	if you look at sample 6 in 1962 the temperature is at 85.10 but then if you look at sample 27 in 2014 its at 88.18
a	177	1	We believe the temperature of the sand does contribute to male or female eggs.  Male's were primarily hatched in the low 80's to 83 range.  Females were primarily hatched in the 85 - 88 range.
a	12	0	I think that this is partly true because at  first it is a egg and then it goes into the caterpillar for a long time then it will go into the chrysalis then the last thing of its cycle is it goes into the butterfly and then it will go to its place to migrate but the place will not be to clod or it will not be to worm  it will  be just right for the butterfly to live in the winter time.
a	331	0	Because it is true
a	644	1	I think that it is false because when it is winter all of the butterflys go to  Mexico. So wen they go there every winter the population will go up.
a	65	1	the leather back turtles gender is of the heat the females are mostly hotter than the males. the two that i pointed to were a boy and a girl the girls 5 hotter than the boy
a	662	1	I think that the second claim is wrong because if you look at the chart close  enough you will see that the butterfly population is increasing in Mexico its not staying the same because if you at the chart under the word count the numbers show that the population is increasing not staying the same.
a	556	0	it is false because i 1960 it was 84.56 degrees, and in 1962 it was 85.10 degrees, so it is not decreasing.
a	366	0	I think its false because every year its grows to more counts  but in the claim it said the populations stayed the same every year.
a	601	0	becaues it not chaging\n
a	686	0	Because it is not straight line.
a	291	1	I think this claim is true because the caterpillars that were in warmer places have already gone to chrysalis stage. where as the other ones are still in caterpillar stage.
a	586	0	it went from 33.50 to 909.50
a	485	1	I think the claim is false because in 1960 the temperature was 84.66 on Raine island. Over 58 years it has increased and decreased but in 2018 it has gone up to 85.67.
a	165	1	My claim is that the temperature that a chrysalis is in depends on how fast it grows into an adult because, if the temperature is 50 that is not normal for a butterfly to grow in the average temperature is around 60 degrees Fahrenheit. So if it was 50 degrees it would be below what they are used to so it would grow slower.
a	530	0	I think that the population has gone up by so much it has gone up by like 800 million
a	511	0	Because as the data shows from 1996 to 2013 the number of butterfly has gone down a big number. So what clam two is saying is that the numbers has stay the same but looking at the data you can see that is not true.
a	385	1	the population of monarch butterflies has severely gone down from 1996 to 2013
a	224	0	because  the sand in the summer id most of the time on the top of the sand is hot but on the bottom, it is cool not super cold then  \n   \n? do they lay eggs in the winter
a	515	1	I do not think it has been decreasing because the graph shows otherwise. The data shows the sand going higher from year to year. In 1960 the temporture of the sand was 84.56, and in 2016 (most resent year on graph) the sand was 85.57. So it was not decreasing at all it was actually increasing.
a	671	0	When I sorted the graph by year, I relized that is g from 33.50 to 302.50!!! i think that the population of butter flies is just rising and falling. If the population is about the same how did it go from 33.50 to 302.50 in five years?! I completely disagree with the statement about the population.
a	610	1	The dots on my graph  are all over the place. It goes by the year and count by millions. Some dots are near the bottom and some are near the top. In my chart the numbers range from 33.50 million to 909.50.
a	650	1	i think this claim is false because the data table shows that as years go on the population have been increasing and decressing. Also thats happening because butterflies go there when it gets to cold or to hot where they live and it degreses when they leave to go somewhere else.
a	28	1	i think that this is partly true because the article said that the weather cant be too cold and cant be to warm. i think this could affect how they grow, if the monarch butterfly are in too warm of weather they could not grow properly. if they are in too clod of weather they could take longer to grow, or even worst die. i do agree that it can cause them to to grow. if monarch butterfly are in to warm or harsh weather it could cause the population to go down in stead of up. that is why i think climate can cause butterfly to not grow.
a	614	0	it is not true in 1960 the temperature was 84.56 and in 2016 it was 85.57.
a	389	0	I think is's false from 1996 the was 909.50 million butterflies going to Mexico compared 2018 with 302.50 million to 2013 with only 33.50
a	71	0	Because the temperature is higher.
a	186	0	because sea turtles are dieing we got to say those sea turtles
a	405	0	The reason i said it was partly true was because 2006 2005 2007 where about the same but years like 2018 2017 are not the same at all.
a	212	1	If a monarch butter was in a cold tempertured area it would take longer because its to cold but if it was really warm the proces would go quicker.
a	337	0	it can tack longer for some butterfly's to go in to a chrysalis, then others.
a	242	1	because at temperatures higher than 60 the caterpiller would be in a chrysalis and any lower it was still a caterpiller.
a	668	1	I think that the temicher has been increasing over the years and with clow 1 it shows that feamaels thriv in wormnes so if it is incresing in tempicher then there will be more feamael then mael and that is why thay are in daenger.
a	398	0	i think it is false because the sand cant get colder anly the water can
a	347	1	I think this because if you look at the graph, then you can see that the average of female turtles are born in the warmer temperatures and the male turtles are born in the more cold temperatures.
a	597	1	the butterfly population has dropped at increasing speeds instead of staying the same, the evidence is in 1996 the butterfly population was 909.50 million and in 2013 it is at 33.50 million.
a	309	1	it does affect how quickly it goes through the life cycle \nbecause there are more chrysalis in the warmer weather so the colder weather makes it harder for them to go through life cycle stages.
a	687	0	The numbers of the butterfly is not the same
a	607	0	jlb
a	225	1	After studying the data I conclude that the sea turtles who were born when the sand temperatures were 84 degrees primarily turned out as females. But when the temperatures were 83.99 degrees and below the sea turtle were males.
a	551	0	you got to save the tretel\n
a	497	1	The scientists are saying that the butterfly's population is staying the same but from 1996 to 2013 they have lost loads of butterfly's and the scientists are saying that the butterfly's population in Mexico is staying about the same.
a	66	0	I think the claim is false because there were similar tempters and it was out of order if it was male or female and in the wild scientists cant control the tempter of the beach so why wouldn't there be more of one type of gender
a	245	1	sometimes the female leatherbacks are born around 84 degrees to 87 degrees.\n
a	424	0	because eavry one of them are diffrent numbers\n
a	213	0	It's false because if you look at the data, there are still some caterpillars that have the same temperature as the ones in the chrysalis's. That means they are in the same temperature as the ones who are growing up faster.
a	611	1	The highest temperature was in 2002. The lowest temperature was in 1968. On my graph the temperature was going up and down not just a line going down. If anything the temperature is going up for 1960.
a	289	1	I think that it is true because when the temperature is higher there are mostly chrysalis and when it is colder there are more caterpilers.
a	430	0	because in the picture it was dawn and some time's its cold at night time
a	663	1	its false because the temperature did not go down it went up
a	676	0	The years are going up and the temperature is not getting warmer or colder it is staying in the 83.0-87.0 range
a	185	0	because It's mostly the same temperature.
a	315	1	according to the chart higher temperatures seem to have female eggs and lower the temperatures seem to have more male. but in the middle of the chart mae and female are a little mixed up.
a	564	0	I think this is false because number 27 is 2014 and 86 degrees and then we look at 1990 its also 86 degrees and then in 2016 its 85 degrees
a	510	0	because some places sand and stuff can be a different but idk if has been changeing
a	559	1	the temp has been rising instead of going down
a	104	1	The claim is false because I sorted it lowest to highest temperature and the caterpillars was yes, all in one group, but they kept going back 'n' forth. Caterpillars, chrysalis, then back to caterpillars. \nSo therefor the caterpillars will form into pupa at different rates in different temperature, however, it changes groups in the same temperature!\nFor instance, 59.36 is in the caterpillar bunch, but, the pupa is in 59.54.So maybe temperatures could support faster growth, however, due to the continuous changing i believe that this statement is also incorrect. That is why the statement is partly true, and partly false.\n
a	581	1	It has decreased over the years in 1996 it was 909.50 and in 2013 it was 33.50. It has decreased a lot over the years so that statement is false. it almost went down 890.50
a	494	1	every year since 1996 the monarch butterfly population has gone down every time a new year comes so the butterfly population cannot be the same if in 1996 909.50 million butterflies and the in 2013 there are only 33.50 million they have gone down by about 878 million
a	257	0	most shows that the tep is difrent but they still grow the samw
a	667	1	I think that the graf macs it clear that the populaeshun is going down.
a	656	0	On the chart after 1960 it sometimes get higher and sometimes lower.
a	561	0	I have made a chart so you can see that I am right because they esmated.
a	116	0	I think That It's Partly true And Partly False Because When You Look At the chart it Kinda Changes The form By tempature But it Kinda Doesn't.
a	223	0	because the tempature is the same all the time or in the same range or temp.
a	418	1	i think this claim is partly true and false because monarch count has stayed in the millions but the numbers have gone way lower. since 1996
a	239	0	It was warm and it grew and it was cold and it grew the same time.
a	659	0	Because the lowest amount of butterflies was in 2013 and their was 33.50 . In the middle is 2008 and their was 253.00. then the largest amount was in 1996 and their was 909.50 butterflies!
a	580	0	Yes tbe temperature slowly decended from 86 degrees to 85 then to 84 then back up to 85. So in conclusion the temperature did go down by about a degree.
a	290	1	I think it is true because a lot of the low temperatures are males and high is mostly female.
a	56	1	The sand temperature affects whether leatherback eggs hatch as male or female because looking at the data, males have lower temperatures while the females have more.\n
a	508	0	The report dos not say it decreases.
a	39	0	I believe this claim is false. I believe it to be false because in the graph you can clearly see there is nearly an equivalent amount of male and female leatherback hatchlings. In addition, they are hatched in the same temperature range of about 80 to 85 Fahrenheit.
a	240	1	because most of the time there are male and female sometimes there are just female and sometimes the a just males because male need to be colder to the ground or the won't be a male they will then be a female. female need to be warmer than the males if there to cold they will most likely to be a male
a	642	1	I think this statement is false because I put the temperature in a graph and it seemed to be incresing.
a	99	0	latherback sea turtles are the bigest species. and they can get up to 2000 pounds but the green sea turtle can get up to 500 pounds an live up to 100 years old
a	27	0	If the monarch butterfly goes through the stages fast then it's probably used to doing something fast and not having the patients to do stuff so that's probably one of it's habit
a	13	0	I think it doesn't mater
a	408	0	The number of butterfly have continuously been going up and down each year some dropping my the millions but the number is always changing each year making me say that this claim is false and that the number of butterflies has stayed the same each year. the lowest the butterfly population has been was in 2013 and the most is has been was in 1996 the numbers are way different than this author said.
a	440	1	It has not decreased since 1960 it accutally risen a little bit. Because, if you look on the chart 1960 the temperature was 84.56 put then in about ten years it droped down a little bit but then rose back up, In 2002 the temperature was 86.72. It has risen 1.26 in the temperature.
a	513	0	I think this is Partly True/Partly False because if you look at 1960 #24 the temperature is 84.56 F. Then in 1968 it decreases #14 to 83.75 F. So far its true but then in 1988 #5 it increases to 85.59 F and it really just keeps this process going over and over.
a	545	0	the chart shows that its decreasing
a	318	0	I think this is partly true and partly false because, when I sorted the data lowest temperature to highest, the lowest temperatures had mostly caterpillars. When I looked at the higher temperatures it had mostly chrysalises.There were still a few caterpillars in the high temperatures so I think this fact is partly true,partly false
a	675	0	In 1996 909.50M butterflies were in Mexico but in 2013 only 33.50 butterflies were in Mexico that is a big difference so it has not stayed about the same.
a	384	0	As seen in the chart sample one is shown the highest. If you look underneath it you can see sample number 27 and 26. This shows that the climate of the island has not changed very much. Yes, the last test is showed low but most of the other tests show high temperatures.
a	539	0	because in 1996 there was 909 and a half million and in 2013 there is only 33 and a half million
a	178	0	The claim is false because one Monarch it grew up at 59.54 degrees, and it is in the 3rd stage of growing which is the chrysalis. While a Monarch who grew up in warmer temps at 63.14 degrees is at the same step in there life cycle the chrysalis. And that is why this claim is false
a	340	1	I think that the temperature affects the turtle eggs hatching male or female because as you can see on my graph, most of the lower temperatures are male, and the higher temperatures are female.
a	600	1	The temupature since 1860 has been going up until 2000s and started to go down and up.
a	363	1	The chart clearly shows the population decrease from 909 million to 33 million and maybe it is due to natural causes or something happened  on the way
a	623	1	In 1968 the temperature was 83.75 and in 2002 the temperature was 86.72 so it was going higher
a	190	0	i choose no because all sands are the same
a	709	0	the global warming is effecting the sand which makes it to hot
a	453	1	In 1960 the sand temperature was 84.56 and in 2016 the sand temperature was 85.57. So clearly it has not been decreasing it has actually been increasing.
a	26	0	idk brynn brynn brynn brynn brynn brynn brynn brynn brynn
a	102	1	I can see that the Female has bigger numbers then the Males
a	203	1	Normaly when the temp is in the 60's they usually are in their chrysalis period of transformation. But one of the chrysalis periods is in the 50 to 59 degree range.
a	298	1	I think that claim 1 is true because when the sand gets hot its most likely that a female will hatch. So when it gets colder some of the males will be born so what I am saying is whenever the sand gets hot a female comes out. Whenever the sand is cold and warm a male will come out.
a	648	0	If you look closely you will see that the temperature is also  increasing but as the year goes past the temperature is decreasing.It is doing both increasing and decreasing because if you look at the last two temperatures you will see that it will decrease but the very last one is increasing.
a	292	1	I believe that the sand temperature affects whether leatherback eggs hatch as male or female and here's why. because the lower 80s are mostly male the middle temp. 80s are a good mix, and the high 80s are mostly female.
a	409	0	I think that this claim is false because when i was looking at the data for butterfly population I lined up the years from least to greatest and i started at the year 1993 because that's when scientists started keeping track of the monarch butterfly population and i saw that it kept on climbing up and the population started getting bigger and bigger.
a	635	0	well back when they first started keeping track it was the highest number and it was still really high then it was all over the place so it wasn't the same or it would have roughly the same numbers by years but they are just all over the place so i think they are wrong.
a	330	0	I think its true because males and females are different just like a girl and boys are different and turtles need the right temperature to have baby turtles yes playa and suriname is a place that I dont know it is very warm 80 degres of the sand is very warm for baby turtles baby turtles need the same temperature same of the two places have different temps turtles are babys the sand might be too hot or too cold turtles need the right place the also need the weather to be warm to go in the cold water because the water will be even more cold if there is not sun the water will be warm
a	360	0	I think this claim is false. I think that because it is all around the same number. \n\nI think that because in almost all the numbers are 85 degress  for exsample 17 out of 29 are 85 degress. \n\nAnother reason I think this is because the temperture goes down by like 1 degree and then it goes back up. for example it goes down to 84 degress and then goes back up to 85 degress.\n\nin conclusion i think this claim is false
a	705	0	its more worm down in mexico
a	53	1	I believe that the claim is partly true and partly false because in some parts it shows that maybe the cooler temperatures can change the affects is has on the life cycles but also the temperature is not really changing the affects because there may be a section where a cooler temperature shows that the life cycle is in the caterpillar form then is switches to a chrysalis but it can then switch back to the caterpillar making me believe it is partly true and partly false.
a	161	1	The temperature was higher for females.
a	20	0	hdjhvjusdnvh
a	369	0	the article said so
a	681	0	In 1993 there was about 316 butterflies but in 2018 there was about 300 butterflies\n
a	502	0	the temperature is always within 2 degrees\n
a	265	0	some of the chrysalis are at the 56 degree mark but most of them are from 60 to
a	45	1	in the lower tempature there are mainly males till 84.20 then it is mixed till 85.42 where the rest are al female
a	692	1	Each year the count goes done
a	64	0	I think this claim is true because the butterfly can't be in the cold or high winds unlike a caterpillar that stays on the ground.
a	259	0	I think sand temperature affects leatherbacks so they hatch as male or female. Temperature from as low as 84.20 to as hi as 88.08. Males are as low as 80.60 and as hi as 85.19.
a	228	0	It is false because it never said anything about the temperature.  And it didn't say anything really about the male and female.
a	573	0	when they keep tract of them they can see were they are Going
a	443	0	becase mecsco is a relhy wome stat. they wodnot be daed.
a	341	0	it is arowed the same temp
a	400	0	because in 1960 the tempature was 84.56 in 1994 the tempature was 85.57 as so in 2016
a	478	1	its not the same. the population has jumped around but has gotten smaller. it slowly gets smaller.
a	127	1	Most of the male eggs are hatched in cooler weather, however most of the female eggs are in a little bit warmer weather
a	70	0	I really don't know.
a	587	1	from different years it goes up and down but It seems that Its increasing than decreasing. In 2002 and up its going up in heat that getting colder in those years so I presonly don't  think its decreasing I think its increasing.
a	103	0	becuse i feel like it is true and
a	532	1	We believe this is false because since 1960 the temperatures have risen.
a	170	1	I think that it is partially true because it shows that the warmer the temperature the faster it will grow but, I believe this only goes for when the caterpillar is outside because it seems that when a caterpillar is inside it doesn't grow as quickly because  it's not in it's natural habitat.
a	97	0	i think  it is false because they don't rush right throw  there life sycel
a	229	0	it's partly true and partly false because maybe the sand temperature does affect whether leatherback eggs to hatch as male or female but it could be false because it depends on the gender who knows if the sand temperature affects the animal's gender
a	373	0	Because I said so
a	689	0	I think its false because the numbers go up and down and up down each year.
a	574	1	Because the monarch butterfly in mexico close to this year is dropping, dropping, and rising, it's never stayed in one place like the tens without bumping up a bit.
a	96	0	Because when it's a girl the temperature is in the 80's and when its a boy the temperature is in the 80's too.
a	615	0	it is not true in 1960 the temperature was 84.56 and in 2016 it was 85.57.
a	339	0	i think this because everything is different and if it is true when its inside and 59 above it does seem a little true.
a	160	0	Claim: My claim is that the tempeture of the sea turtles eggs doesnt affect the gender. \nEvidence: In the data it doesn't neccarsily show weather or not the it makes a different of the gender on the types of sea turtles. For example the lowest tempeture. The highest temperture is 88.8 which is a female. The lowest temperture is 80.60 which is a male. Also in the data all the tempertures are mixed around it doesnt show anything like females are always hotter and males are colder and vice versa.\nReasoning: That is the reasoning why i do not think that the tempeture of the egg in the sand does not impact the gender of the sea turtle.
a	15	0	The Sea turtles, male or female, are born at a temperature of 80 to 90 degrees F.
a	216	0	I think it is true because if it hurting the eggs then it will start to hurt the baby turtel inside and that means there might not be anymore turtels after this!
a	608	0	I think this claim is partly true because mostly a lot of females make it to Mexico to lay eggs when they hatch the females die. That wouldn't make the population of butterflies be exactly the same. The females lay several eggs witch would make more not the same. It is almost rare for butterflies to make it back from Mexico because of the weather or they die in Mexico.
a	436	0	because i was watching a lazar beam vid and he said tutles are mostly laying eggs in kindoff middil tempature  but i belive hed tell us if they were laying eggs in warm wether or cold wether
a	121	0	I think its partly true and partly false Because, it depends where they are like if there  Africa i could be jest right or too hot or in Maine it could be to cold that's why they go away for the winter. They go the warmer climits when there climit is too cold. That's why I think its partly true and partly false.
a	81	0	because when my uncle was in the coast gaured  had to practice scuba diving and when he did did they broat like a almost 100 year old turtle in i think i said i think to do somethng with it he never told me what he did with the turtle
a	566	0	I think this is true because global warming could change the tempature of the sand.\n
a	5	1	I think this claim is true because all the females numbers are within a couple of numbers of each other. And it is the same for male.\n\nI think this because in the data it says on one piece of evidence that it was 85.82 degress and it was a female then another one said 85.54 and that was a female. \n\nanother reason i think this is because in the data it says 80.56 and it was a male then another one said 80.60 and that was a male to.\n\nin conclusion I think claim 1 is true.\n\n
a	208	1	i think it is  true because in this story it said it was faster when it was warm and not when it was cold\n
a	402	1	I think it is false because if you look at the temperature in 1960 it is lower than in 2016, so than means that the temperature is not decreasing, that means that the temperature is increasing from 1960 to 2016.
a	131	0	Becuase if its cold the monarch will die becuse it does not have much fat on it so if will freeze to death
a	250	0	because it said it in the reading
a	77	0	I think its true because in the important data its says the temperature can change if its a girl or boy
a	618	0	that is not true because some numbers were is the 900s and some were only in the 100s so it was all mixed up so i would not say it was about the same.
a	268	0	I looked at the chart and saw a female and male turtle that live in different places but same temputure
a	167	1	I think the sand temperature does affect whether the turtle is male or female according to the data chart any temperature under 85 degrees the egg hatches and it's a male any temperature above 85 when the egg hatches it's a female.
a	7	1	I think this claim is true because whether sea turtles lay there eggs in the sand and the different temperatures that effect in there eggs shell could change there formation of themselves. To turn into to a male or female. Also I notice that the temperatures stay in the eighties maybe  that also has something to do with it. Males usually in Suriname tend to stat around in under the 85's but females on the other hand stay above an 85 maybe that's a reason the come out male or female.\n
a	395	0	the numbers ether drop or raise depending on the year
a	413	1	In 1996 the count was 909.50 million and just a year after it dropped to 630.50 and all the way up in 2013 the count was 33.50 million so it has dropped about 880 million.
a	612	0	it has mostly changed
