0	i dont now
1	I said what I said because of males where more cornix born in colder places
0	I think the first claim is partly right and partly wrong because if you look at the data close enough you will see that the highest temperature is 63.14 and the life cycle stage is a chrysalis and as the temperature goes down you see that the life cycle stage has changed into a caterpillar so the life cycle of stage of the butterflies is taking a bit longer.
0	This answer is false because looking at the temperature range, it's staying in the same range from 1960 and up.
1	I made a graph to show whether the temperature has been decreasing or not and the graph showed me that the weather has been increasing. So, it is false the weather has not been decreasing
1	I think this claim is false because if you see on the data when monarch butterfly's  are inside they can be a caterpillar or a chrysalis. But on the outside it shows that it can be the same as the indoor. Also as you can see lower temperatures and higher temperatures can both be caterpillars or chrysalis's. So I don't believe the temperature affects them or the habitat.
1	The population went down almost 900 million in only 17 years. The butterfly population went down 13 million in one year. Therefore, the population is going down rapidly!
0	The claim is that temperature of the the sand in Rain has been decreasing since 1960. I think that it is sort of true, because the highest the highest temp. that the sand reached was 86.72. that was in 2002. the lowest temp. that the sand reached was 83.75, that was in 1968. so the sand has been getting to temps. in between both those numbers.
0	I looked  at the smallest tempsort and it is 2002 With i found helpfullbeculs  In means it is NOT decreasing if 1960 is only 8456
0	well back when they first started keeping track it was the highest number and it was still really high then it was all over the place so it wasn't the same or it would have roughly the same numbers by years but they are just all over the place so i think they are wrong.
1	I think this claim is partly true and partly false. I think this because if you look at the males most of them have lower temperatures than the females. Most males are 85 to 80 for their temperatures. As you see most females are 85 and up. But some males are higher than 85 and some females are lower than 85. But as you see most females are higher than 85 and most males are lower than 85.
0	I think it is not changing because they are all different and all over the place with the temperature
0	it might of been decreasing because of the weather
0	I said it is false because when I looked at the data as the year went higher the temperature moving up. For example, in 1960 the temperature was 84 degrees and in 2014 it was 86 degrees.
1	I think that the temperature affects the turtle eggs hatching male or female because as you can see on my graph, most of the lower temperatures are male, and the higher temperatures are female.
0	In 1993 there was about 316 butterflies but in 2018 there was about 300 butterflies
0	because it says that on the recording page and every year it gets lower
0	I think the scientists are wrong the sands are not going down in temperature and the graph provides the evidence to support. Yes by the graph the sands go up and down every recorded time like it can go up then it can go down then back up then down but the last one is back up which supports my stupid claim
1	i think this claim is true because when the temperature  is warmer most of the butterflies stay inside. When, the temperature is colder most of them stay outside to make there chrysalis.
1	I can see that the Female has bigger numbers then the Males
0	I think this is true because if it is super cold outside the butter fly will be very cold and might freeze to death.  But if it is to hot the butter fly might die of heat.
0	The temperature has been mostly the same when you look at the data, so obviously, it wouldn't be decreasing over the years.
0	I know that this claim is false. I know this because the temperature is barley changing. Over all the temperature is increasing rather than decreasing. This claim is opposite from the truth.
1	I think this is partly true and partly false because their is one section where the graph doesn't support the claim of sand temperature affecting the gender. The graph also shows that the claim cant be fully false.
0	australias nesting area is the most important nesting area so it cant be decreasing
0	no because it goes from 85.21 to 86.72 also it keeps going from 84 to 85.
0	it goes up and down in the data.
1	I think it is partly true party false. If you look at the claim it is (the sand temperature affects weather leatherback eggs hatch as male or female.) Then look at the chart male temperature is from 85.19 to 80.60. Then look at female the temperature is from 88.8 to 84.20 so to me it looks like that if there is a higher temperature then there is a female and a lower temperature for a male. But I only think it is partly true partly false because the temperatures 84 and 85 are both in range for them both.
0	I think this claim is partly true partly false because it has to be a certain temperature for a cryselis to form.
0	i picked partly true and party false because i feel like a butterfly starts asa caterpillar then grows to be a butterfly like other butterfly like ones we have in maine like the ones that come out in the summer and they have to have temperature thats not to hot or cold that is what i think\
0	this is boring
0	I think this is true because global warming could change the temperature of the sand.
1	I think that the second claim is wrong because if you look at the chart close  enough you will see that the butterfly population is increasing in Mexico its not staying the same because if you at the chart under the word count the numbers show that the population is increasing not staying the same.
0	Because it is not straight line.
1	It has not decreased since 1960 it actually risen a little bit. Because, if you look on the chart 1960 the temperature was 84.56 put then in about ten years it dropped down a little bit but then rose back up, In 2002 the temperature was 86.72. It has risen 1.26 in the temperature.
0	because ofclimat change
1	there has been forest fires in Australia. its been alot hotter there since before the fire
1	it does affect how quickly it goes through the life cycle because there are more chrysalis in the warmer weather so the colder weather makes it harder for them to go through life cycle stages.
0	If it stayed about the same it would have been in the 30s but now it went from thirty three to 56.50 within a year.
0	Yes it has because it's been at a constant migration of the protest of the change of the butterfly started at 2020 to 1996.
0	Beaches the heat does not damage it but it could
0	I think is true its because the monarch butterflies like it warn in Mexico.
0	As seen in the chart sample one is shown the highest. If you look underneath it you can see sample number 27 and 26. This shows that the climate of the island has not changed very much. Yes, the last test is showed low but most of the other tests show high temperatures.
0	I think its only Party True / Partly False. I think this because if you look at the data you will see mainly in one locations its true about the claim but once you look at both you see that it's its not all true. Because for example #28 and #2 Work then if you look at another pair such as #22 and #26 it doesn't work in the slightest if you compare with the first example.
0	If you look at number 26 the temperature is 63.14 and the butterfly is in its chrysalis but if you look at number 29 the butterfly is a caterpillar
0	The graph shows that the temps of the sand have decrease but in some years they got higher.
0	i dont know
0	i think its true because the temperature affects whether leatherback eggs hack then they will die
0	I believe this claim is false. I believe it to be false because in the graph you can clearly see there is nearly an equivalent amount of male and female leatherback hatching. In addition, they are hatched in the same temperature range of about 80 to 85 Fahrenheit.
0	if the sand is hot it will effect the eggs
0	because I said so
0	lb
1	When you look at the chart pay attention to the numbers of the population. It was going downward! In 1993 the population was 3 million to 1996, 9 million now look at 2013, 33 million! It was in the hundred million not 10 million! You can not say it has stayed the same when it fell down to 10 million. I think the claim is False!
0	it will stay the same because it is warm all year around
1	because its going down every year
1	I think that the temperature in the sand in Rain Island, Australia has NOT been decreasing since 1960, because in our data, the temperature is actually increasing instead of decreasing, for example in 1960, the temperature was 84.5 F, and in 2016, the temperature is up to 85.5.
1	After studying the data I conclude that the sea turtles who were born when the sand temperatures were 84 degrees primarily turned out as females. But when the temperatures were 83.99 degrees and below the sea turtle were males.
0	in mexico the count of marnark butter fly stay the same because it is always worm there
1	The highest temperature was in 2002. The lowest temperature was in 1968. On my graph the temperature was going up and down not just a line going down. If anything the temperature is going up for 1960.
0	i said no because it says on the top temperature 85.80 and its a female and on the 2nd one down is says 85.04 and its a male
0	In 1996 there were 909.50 mil butterflies. But in 2013 there were 33.50 mill and that is not a lot.
1	I think this claim is partly true and false because the monarch count has stayed in the millions but the numbers have increasingly have gone way lower sense 1996.
0	I think its False because its not the first one to be the lowest number
0	At 1998 first to number is getting lower just like what the claim #2 have say about that Rain Island, Australia, has been decreasing since 1960. but then the rest is the increasing then decreasing. I might actually not really know what their meanings are.
0	I think that the population has gone up by so much it has gone up by like 800 million
1	It has decreased over the years in 1996 it was 909.50 and in 2013 it was 33.50. It has decreased a lot over the years so that statement is false. it almost went down 890.50
1	I think that it is partially true because it shows that the warmer the temperature the faster it will grow but, I believe this only goes for when the caterpillar is outside because it seems that when a caterpillar is inside it doesn't grow as quickly because  it's not in it's natural habitat.
1	if anything the temperature has bean going up in stead of down because if you look is goes from 84.56 all the way to 85.57
0	as you see the years to 1960 to 2016 the 1960 is at 84.56but the 2016 is at 85.57 so it is false
0	it does not ladder about the weather. It just ladders what the turtle gave birth to in the eggs.
0	i think its true because it said in the subtitle that this was true.
1	I think this claim is true because, when I organized the data by temperature, I saw some patterns. First, when the eggs were in the 54 - 59.36 degree range, they were all caterpillars. Second, when the eggs were in the 59.37 - 60.90 degree range, they were a mixture of caterpillars and chrysalises. Lastly, when the eggs were in the 60.91 - 64 degree range, they were all chrysalises. That is why I think the claim is true. The temperature of a monarch butterfly's habitat does affect how quickly it goes through its life cycle stages.
1	Well, when I sorted the data by temperature lowest to highest, I looked at the life cycle stages and first there were a chunk of caterpillar  and then chrysalis  then more caterpillars back and fourth. I think that if the claim was true then all the caterpillars would be together and all the chrysalis would be together.
0	because the sometimes they will momentarily leave the area
0	I think this claim is false. I think that because it is all around the same number. I think that because in almost all the numbers are 85 degrees  for example 17 out of 29 are 85 degrees. Another reason I think this is because the temperature goes down by like 1 degree and then it goes back up. for example it goes down to 84 degrees and then goes back up to 85 degrees.in conclusion i think this claim is false
0	The sand temperature does not hove anything to do with if the leatherback being male or female.
0	when I sorted the temperatures from lowest to highest the highest temperature was in 2002 so i do not think they have been going down since 1960
0	because
0	Because mexico can not stay the same it have to change at some point that's what I think.
0	Female or Male they go to warm places where temperature go up to 80 degrees. They always go to warmer places
0	fight
0	I really don't know.
0	it went from 33.50 to 909.50
1	I think it is false. So look at the chart at 1960 the temperature is 84.56 but almost every year after that it has been 85 or 86 but some have been 84 but most are higher on 84. But on 1964,1970 and 1972 are all lower but it said that it has been decreasing since 1960 which means every year after that but way more are higher plus the last year is 85.57 which is also higher.
0	the temp of the sand doesn't change
1	in the year 2016 the temperature was higher than in 1960
0	I think it is not engine because it do not say that it is
0	hdjhvjusdnvh
0	dot no
1	in the lower temperature there are mainly males till 84.20 then it is mixed till 85.42 where the rest are al female
1	higher the temperature the more females hatched
0	When we look at the  year, then at the temperature, we can see that in 1960 the temperature was high, but it said that the temperature in Rain Island was decreasing, which means that it was going down.
0	?
0	the temperature does not seem to affect the butterfly's life cycle.
1	because at temperatures higher than 60 the caterpillar would be in a chrysalis and any lower it was still a caterpillar.
1	I think this is files because most of the higher the textures are still in the chrysallis stage
0	As you can see the claim is false one of the female leatherbacks are 82.45 and it was at surname and a different leatherback was 86.97 and it was at surname so it is false
1	The sand temperature affects whether leather-back eggs hatch as male or female because scientific research proves that when the eggs have been laid in warmer sand, the turtle is a female. When the egg is laid in cooler sand, the turtle is a male. Also, These turtles have been laid in different locations. So we know that in Playa the turtles don't tend to be female. That part is totally random. The Male and Female's were both scattered around Playa and Surname.
1	because some are a high temperature and the monarchs are still caterpillars but some of the low temperatures are chrysalises
0	I think its partly true and partly false because some of the male and females have almost the same exact temperature and some of them have lower or higher temperatures so it can be either gender depending on the goodness or the warmth of the sand or the eggs.
0	So they don't over populate and have too much
1	The count overall got smaller.
0	I think this because some years there very little and some years there was a lot.
0	The answer to the question is false.  It is false because the information I am getting says that it has gone up a lot more.
1	i think it false because of limit chang it get hotel and hotel.
0	if you see the evidence you see that the first 2002 thing is 86.72 degrees but in the 2012 one it is 85.06
0	I think this is partly true and partly false because, when I sorted the data lowest temperature to highest, the lowest temperatures had mostly caterpillars. When I looked at the higher temperatures it had mostly chrysalises.There were still a few caterpillars in the high temperatures so I think this fact is partly true,partly false
1	Some are saying that the temperature of the sand in Rain Island, Australia has been decreasing since 1960. This information is incorrect. As I have made my graph of data that has been collected from the past years, I have found that the temperatures have gone up since 1960, not gone down.
0	I believe that the temperature of the monarchs habitats does not depend on the monarchs habitat temperature. The reason that it doesn't depend on the  temperature is because the results vary between inside and outside of the temperature of the chrysalis. One of the temperature for the chrysalis is 59.54 Fahrenheit  and another is 63.14 Fahrenheit that is a 4 degree difference. Also the colder one is outside and  the hotter one is inside. That's why i Believe that the temperature does not matter for a monarch caterpillar to turn into a chrysalis.
1	I believe that the sand temperature affects whether leatherback eggs hatch as male or female and here's why. because the lower 80s are mostly male the middle temp. 80s are a good mix, and the high 80s are mostly female.
0	throughout most of the early 2000 the count of butterflies stayed realitivly the same only changing slightly fro 200 million to 500 million
1	when it was cold outside they were mostly still caterpillars. I also saw that some of them were inside witch I think has effected how they grew to be butterflies because it was warmer inside then outside some days,  I think that may of effected how they grew.
1	i think that this is partly true because the article said that the weather cant be too cold and cant be to warm. i think this could affect how they grow, if the monarch butterfly are in too warm of weather they could not grow properly. if they are in too cold of weather they could take longer to grow, or even worst die. i do agree that it can cause them to to grow. if monarch butterfly are in to warm or harsh weather it could cause the population to go down in stead of up. that is why i think climate can cause butterfly to not grow.
0	Because the lowest amount of butterflies was in 2013 and their was 33.50 . In the middle is 2008 and their was 253.00. then the largest amount was in 1996 and their was 909.50 butterflies!
0	I know the claim is partly true and partly false. I know this because The hot sand produces females and cold sand produces male turtles. the partly part is because in the middle of the graph, it's a mix of male, and female babies. I sorted it this way because the question was on the temperature of sand.
0	The temperature of the sand in Rain Island, Australia has been decreasing since 1960.
1	the temp has been rising instead of going down
0	In 1996 909.50M butterflies were in Mexico but in 2013 only 33.50 butterflies were in Mexico that is a big difference so it has not stayed about the same.
0	i think that this is false because when the textures are higher it take longer and most people would think that it would go faster because there is more food.
0	when you look at the graph, you can see it stayed about the same, other than a sudden spike in 1995 and 1996.
0	Since 1960 the temperature has bean in the 80's but it has bean going down but not by much at all
1	The caterpillars all went into their pups when the temperature was 59 degrees (F) or higher.
0	I think its false because the numbers go up and down and up down each year.
0	I think it's true because from 1994 to 2006 there has been about ten more or less than the year before and/or the year after that.
0	it dose not mater.
0	its false because the count is going higher over the years.
0	Because it shows inside and outside and two are both caterpillars but then also one is a chrysalis. That is the same tempachure so kinda true kinda false
0	The thing I just read said that the eggs can change but nothing about weather effects the turtle eggs.
0	i think this claim is false because, you can see in  1996 there were 909.50 monarch butterfly a year. now in 2013 there are only 33.50 that is a big difference. its because of the weather and global warming. that is why i think that claim is false. i am not saying they are  wrong but i am giving my thoughts and telling them why i think that.
0	ariana
0	global warming
1	All higher temperatures above 59.50 are in stage 3 or 4 because of how high the temperature is in there location. But just 6 of them are still in stage 2 though.I have thought about it and came up with this theory, they may have been born just went the temperature was warmer and they still are growing fast but just have not made the cut.
1	I think it is true because in the data the lower temperature the more males and the higher temperature the more females.
0	id bryan bryan bryan bryan bryan bryan bryan bryan bryan
0	the reason i think this is false is because marco that not manager come to  main
1	I think that it is true because when the temperature is higher there are mostly chrysalis and when it is colder there are more caterpillars.
0	I think That It's Partly true And Partly False Because When You Look At the chart it Kinda Changes The form By temperature But it Kinda Doesn't.
0	In my graph, the dots representing the number of butterflies are scattered all over the place, definitely not the same. This proves that the claim is false.
0	they won be dead of the temprchor.
0	i think that it is party true and partly false. i think this because even though it is about the same  doesn't mean that it did not drop before.
0	it is browed the same temp
1	I think the claim is true because the graph shows that the highest temperature shows that the catupiler is in its chrysalis the coldest temperature the butterfly was still a catipiller.
1	Because most of the lower temps. are caterpillars and most of the higher temps. are chrysalis.
1	wel the data proves the fact true in the evidence because the higher temp the life cycle proceeded quicker
1	the temp is increasing
1	The data shows that in higher temperatures females are normally hatched.  In lower temperatures male are normally hatched.
1	Each year the count goes done
0	vanessa
0	I think its true because in the important data its says the temperature can change if its a girl or boy
1	The highest temperatures of sand are normally when females are born. The lowest temperatures are mostly male.
1	because the butterfly count goes down a lot ever 1 to 2 years
0	The temperatures are not that different. They are all in the high 50s/low 60s. The majority is the caterpillar even though the temperatures at least 1 degree apart. But then again a few degrees can make a difference depending on the study.
1	When the sand temperature is hotter the eggs hatch as female, and when the sand is cooler the eggs hatch as male. For example, some of the male egg temperature were, 80.60, 82.45, and 83.25. But then some of the female temperatures were, 87.09, 88.08 and 86.54, so there is a big difference in those temperatures which means that the eggs hatch as female when the sand is hotter, and the eggs hatch as male when the sand is cooler.
0	latherback sea turtles are the biggest species. and they can get up to 2000 pounds but the green sea turtle can get up to 500 pounds an live up to 100 years old
0	because this is dumb and I don't want to do it, and so Im not going to try. and also the temperature is literally changed by 1 degree !!!!!!!!
1	In 1996 the count was 909.50 million and just a year after it dropped to 630.50 and all the way up in 2013 the count was 33.50 million so it has dropped about 880 million.
0	think that the temper dose not matter as long as the butter file can survive.
0	i think it is partly true and partly false because the temperature is dropping down and rising back up from the 1960 to the 2016
1	I think that it is false because when it is winter all of the butterfly go to  Mexico. So wen they go there every winter the population will go up.
0	i think this claim is false because in the 1962 the temperature was 85.10 degrees and in 2012 was 85.06. the temperature has only dropped 0.6 degrees in 52 years.
1	I say yes because it seems that the male are in the low 80s and that the male also and the female are hatching as female in the high 80s
0	i think it is true because it said on one that it is a caterpillar and it was 56.84 (F) but then when it was in a scalar so the water songs all the time so the caterpillar is in all finds of whether.
1	I think it is partly true and partly false because most of the sand that was 85 or higher were females, and most of the sand that 85 or lower were males. It isn't like this through the whole thing.
1	when outside it  chrysalis's faster and it's warmer outside
0	i think this claim is false because This table jumps from 556.00 million to 109.50 million
0	86.72 it hier than 85.21   86.72=2020 .     85.21=2008
0	I think that this claim is false because when i was looking at the data for butterfly population I lined up the years from least to greatest and i started at the year 1993 because that's when scientists started keeping track of the monarch butterfly population and i saw that it kept on climbing up and the population started getting bigger and bigger.
1	The scientists are saying that the butterfly's population is staying the same but from 1996 to 2013 they have lost loads of butterfly's and the scientists are saying that the butterfly's population in Mexico is staying about the same.
1	because in the hotter temperature the female eggs hatched
0	The claim is false because one Monarch it grew up at 59.54 degrees, and it is in the 3rd stage of growing which is the chrysalis. While a Monarch who grew up in warmer temps at 63.14 degrees is at the same step in there life cycle the chrysalis. And that is why this claim is false
1	I think it is true because male eggs like the sand cooler then female eggs like the sand .The male eggs like 80 to 85 degrees and female like it 84 to 88 degrees.
1	I think false because, They been going down in the last few years. Also when it goes down also the year is too so this shows something to do with us! Thats why I think its False.
0	because very one of them are different numbers
0	I think when the caterpillar is outside it will get very warm and when the caterpillar is inside it will cool off.
0	The Heights of sand go up and down through the years
0	because more butterfly's have grown sense 1993 so the population has grown and grown sense then
0	The temperatures of a monarch butterfly's can affect the life cycle because for example, the intense heat may interfere with butterfly's natural habitat and life cycle changes and can put heat on monarch butterfly's life cycle by shutting down their organs, or maybe slowing down the process of growing.
1	If a monarch butter was in a cold temperature area it would take longer because its to cold but if it was really warm the process would go quicker.
1	I think the sand temperature does affect whether the turtle is male or female according to the data chart any temperature under 85 degrees the egg hatches and it's a male any temperature above 85 when the egg hatches it's a female.
0	it is partly true and partly false because it has gone up and done in the different years it has changed over all the years it has gone up and down
1	The temperature was going up.
0	it is going down then it goes up up up it decret ones then got even better
0	because it is warm water
1	I think that wen it gets hotel it seams that the spearhead gross faster as you see in the graf.
0	I think this claim is false because, when you look at the graph, the count is not the same, in the years. In 1997, this is the most of the butter fly had been there.(in Mexico.)
1	I think it is false because if you look at the temperature in 1960 it is lower than in 2016, so than means that the temperature is not decreasing, that means that the temperature is increasing from 1960 to 2016.
1	I think it is not true because it side it was decreasing when it has been going up for the most part it only goes down a little bit!
0	If you look at the data you will see the data I highlighted their is a Temperature the same and they are Male and Female.
0	the numbers ether drop or raise depending on the year
0	because some times its colder than other times and its still the same part of the cycle
0	I looked at the chart and saw a female and male turtle that live in different places but same temputure
0	Because more and more butterflies come there each year.
1	the leather back turtles gender is of the heat the females are mostly hotter than the males. the two that i pointed to were a boy and a girl the girls 5 hotter than the boy
0	The data shows that in 1996 the population of the Monarch butterfly was 909.50 and in 2013 the population is 33.50 which shows a gigantic difference through 1996-2013.
0	Because I think that sand can not be wash away from the tech the humans
0	I think that this is false because they say the population stays the same but it doesn't. The population is more scattered than same.
1	We believe the temperature of the sand does contribute to male or female eggs.  Male's were primarily hatched in the low 80's to 83 range.  Females were primarily hatched in the 85 - 88 range.
1	as the temperature ranged from 57-62 the caterpillars turned into stage 3 crysiless depending on the location this could be caused by humidity outside or inside but as it got warmer they changed mostly on the warmer side inside and a little cooler outside again probably from humidity
0	it is false because every year it is going up and up (the number in butterfly are increasing).
1	the butterfly population has dropped at increasing speeds instead of staying the same, the evidence is in 1996 the butterfly population was 909.50 million and in 2013 it is at 33.50 million.
0	I think that the temperature can affect how fast the butterfly goes through it's life cycles because you don't want the temperature to be too hot or too cold, so I think that the outside was perfect temperature because if it was too hot the butterfly would probably not be able to grow as fast but you would want kind of hot so a little hotter then warm. You don't really want it to be that cold for a butterfly because then it won't grow fast you barely want any cold.
0	because the  evidence shows that the temperature is in the 80s so the sand has to be in the 80s to be hatched
0	if its to cold it will freeze to death and if its to warm its perfect temp for it to live
0	every time in two years the temperature was in between 84-86
1	The females are usually hotter.
1	I think this claim is true because when the temperature rises, there seem to be more females. between 84.20-85.19 it is kinda scattered but in general, it seems like the lower the temp. the more males, but the higher the temp. the more females. since this claim doesn't go into many specifics, I think we could say yes, the sand temperature affects the gender of the turtles.
1	the males are at the bottom and some in the middle, the females are at the top there are three in the middle. Also it said in the beginning that the temperature determines if they are male or female.
0	I think this is true because the temperature can effect how the butterfly can grow, also how fast it grows.
1	I think it is false because through the years the population has gone down 100's. For example the population has gone down 876.000 (876 hundredth), from 909.50 to only 33.50. So that is why I think that it is false.
0	i'm not good with math
0	it can tack longer for some butterfly's to go in to a chrysalis, then others.
0	because in the picture it was dawn and some time's its cold at night time
1	In the graph, you can see many of the females were found in Playa and many of the males in Surname. The temperature for the females is mostly high ranging from 88-84. From this, we can make the claim that females spawn in warmer climates. As the males spawn in cooler areas.
1	I think that claim 1 is true because when the sand gets hot its most likely that a female will hatch. So when it gets colder some of the males will be born so what I am saying is whenever the sand gets hot a female comes out. Whenever the sand is cold and warm a male will come out.
0	Most of the monarchs are still caterpillars because it takes a long time to create a chrysalis,and since it takes long to make a chrysalis it is partly true.But if we did the same but with only chrysalis we will see that its just in the middle.
0	The reason why is because heat can change how will it goes thought it's cycle because it can shell up and it could die in the cold due to the texture drop.
1	the weather makes the monarch slow done if it is to cold out they stay as caterpillars and when it is hot they grow up faster. They grow faster if they eat more.they grow slow if it is 61 to 54 farinhitemost of these are still caterpillars because it is still cold
0	in 2013 there were 33.50 million and in 1996 there was 909.50 million and that is an 876 million difference.
0	Sea turtles are kinda the same as people. When they are born the heat doesn't change the gender. For ex: Sample number 3 and 16 They both have 84 as there temperature but one is female and one is male. It depends on if the father gave that egg the X or Y in the chromosomes.
0	I think it's true because, I think that when it's hot the chrysalis is more likely to be wanting to get out of the chrysalis. The butter fly could also be wanting to dry it's wings on the sun ( because it's hot.)
1	The monarch butterfly population has decreased by millions. The amount in 1996 909.50, to 2013 33.50. That was a HG decrease in population. I should have their job because I even know that.
0	"in 1996 the butterfly population in Mexico was 909.50 million. But scientists say that the population has always been about the same?! thats not possible. Because the earliest time they have so far is in 2018. and in 2018 there were only 302.50 million butterfly\'s. So i think the scientist who stated this is very off. 909.50 compared to 302.50 is a big difference, the butterfly population in Mexico has not ""stayed the same."""
0	if the caterpillar is in the cold weather mean it is in a chrysalis it would slow it down the save its energy.
1	Because when You Look At Them It starts at 909.50 and goes all the way down to 33.50. So It Dropped Very Low When through the years.
1	its false because the temperature did not go down it went up
1	when it is the warmer climates the eggs are female and when the climates are below 85  they are male
0	The temperatures
1	I say that it is false because the weather is staying at the mid 85-88 and that means it is only getting warmer not colder
0	I think that is partly true and partly false because overtime in 1960 the temperature was 84 degrees it did get hotter but it did call down sometime but gobble warming witch is making the weather warmer also it goes down and up so i guess it is kind of the same
1	i think this claim is partly true and false because monarch count has stayed in the millions but the numbers have gone way lower. since 1996
1	when the temperature is lower most of the butterfly are still caterpillars and when the temperature is higher most of the butterfly are chrysalis
1	when i shorter the years i  the new one is the hottest with 85.57 and the last is 84.56
0	because
0	the temperature does affect the life cycle of butterflies according to the evidence on the table.
0	Most eggs don't hatch with warm weather but they also can hatch themselves.
0	it shows that really no matter what temp it is that any male or female can hatch
0	I think this because the graph didn't show anything about the turtle amount.
0	the tempocher stead the same
1	I think that this is true because mostly the females are born in hotter sands but all the temputaures are close together which would make me conclude that it would be true. Climate change might over populate the sea turtles because if more female are born in hotter sands that there is going to be a lot more female sea turtles to lay there eggs. This could also impact the population in a different way. That way being there would be not enough males so they could not mate. So that would make the population drop.
1	I think the claim is true because outside it is 56.84 degrees  and the butterfly is in the caterpillar stage. The other one says that it is 59.54 degrees and the butterfly in in it's chrysallis stage.
0	I think it is true because a turtle needs to feel comfortable when they are laying their eggs.
0	I don't think it really matters were they are born or what temp it is they will be any gender really think surname has more boys than girl and playa has more girls than boys.
0	most shows that the top is different but they still grow the same
0	Each year there's a little bit of a difference and sometimes it stays the same. In 1993 when scientists started estimating butterfly population the population was about 311.50 and the lowest one was in 2013 and it was 33.50.
0	Yes the temperature slowly defended from 86 degrees to 85 then to 84 then back up to 85. So in conclusion the temperature did go down by about a degree.
0	i don't know you tell me
1	In 1960 Temperature was 84.56 and in 2016 the Temperature was 85.57 so it increased.
1	The graph provided with the investigation shows that commonly the higher temperature sands normally have hatching female turtles unlike hatching male turtles that do their thing in colder sands. Now in the graph, some male turtles hatch in warmer sands than female hatching turtles but not as often as the other way around. I still stick with my decision with true with my reasons conveniently said and the graph for evidence
1	because it is not staying the same actually it is getting lower
0	Out of time
0	because more monarch butterfly's are coming in to Mexico
1	When the temperature is higher its seems to male it slower because all of the chrysalis is 59 degrees or above and all of the caterpillars are 60 degrees and under. The chrysalis stage comes first and is all a higher temp than the caterpillars stage is after the chrysalis stage and is a lowe temp.
0	well some years it was decreasing and some years it was getting hotter so i dont know if thats a true fact that ever since 1960 the sand temp has been decreasing
0	because in 1960 the temperature was 84.56 in 1994 the temperature was 85.57 as so in 2016
0	I think false because I assorted the data table by lowest to highest year and from 1960-2016 the range in temperature stayed within  83-86 it could not be decreasing.
1	the monarch is a caterpillar when it is below 59 degrees and its a chrysalis when it is 59 degrees or higher.  But not always, #3 was a caterpillar while it was 59.36 degrees and #29 was still a cater pillar when it was 60.90 degrees.
0	I thinks it is true because a Leather back  can have male or female. some male and female have temper in there body that makes it feel warm or cold.
1	i think it is  true because in this story it said it was faster when it was warm and not when it was cold
0	if it did rain since 1960 the sand will be wet
1	I think this claim is true because when the monarch butterfly was outside and the temperature was at 56.84 it was only a caterpillar. But when a different monarch butterfly was also outside at a temperature of 59.54, it was already  in a chrysalis.
1	I believe that the female are born in the higher temperature than the males. The numbers on the board for females the highest is 87.09 for for the temp, but for the boys it's like 83.62 for the temp.
0	because there are no data that the monarch butterfly has stayed in one place for many times in a row. it did not come back in 2013 but they did come back in 2014. so it is false they did not stay in on place for a while
1	I think this claim is false because if you look at the evidence you see that it has barely going up, and it has stayed in the 80's for most of the years.
0	I think this claim is false because the population has not stayed the same, this is because as the years increase the butterfly number increases to.for example in 1996 there were 33.50 million and fast forward to 2003 there were 556.00 and it just keeps dropping and soon there will be no butterflies.
1	when the feature became hotter and more dense the butterfly started going through the cycles of their transformation
0	BASE In HOMEAFOBIC AND I ATE TRANSEGENDER
0	they cep track of the butrflis and the polplashen it just fin and the botrflis are fin that do what the wont when ever that wont .
0	I think it is true because if it hurting the eggs then it will start to hurt the baby turtle inside and that means there might not be anymore turtles after this!
0	because it will still be in the 50 or 60 degrees if it is outside or inside
0	the important info says the tempecher effects the gender.  its right because with my evidence it effects the turtles by gender.it also says that the temp effects the turtles in the story.s
0	all the temperatures are reasonably close to each other
0	I think this is true because if you read 20 you can see why I think it is the right answer.
1	This thought is partly true/partly false because the sand in the 1960's through the 1982's these years had the lowest temps in theses years all the other years above that mostly are higher numbers
0	the global warming is affecting the sand which makes it to hot
0	because all the year I saw were all different yes. but, one of the things it showed that in 2002 86.72 for the heat in ('F). it shows that in 1994 in was 85.57  for the heat in ('F.
1	I think this statement is false because I put the temperature in a graph and it seemed to be increasing.
1	there are more female in the higher temp and the males are in the lower temp and they kind of mix in the middle
0	When I sorted the data by year(lowest to highest), I found that the amount has increased and then decreased through the years. It has not stay really stayed the same.
0	ariana
0	I think it's false because in the data It looks like the population for monarch in Mexico is decreasing. In 1993 the population of monarch in Mexico was 311.50. I think it was increasing and now it is decreasing. The highest year on the data chart is 2017 the population is 124.00 in 2017.
1	The temperature for male eggs was between 80-86, which is lower than the 84-87 that the female eggs had. I believe that if the egg is warmer, females will hatch. If it's colder, males will hatch.
0	because it not changing
1	I think that the teacher has been increasing over the years and with low 1 it shows that females thrive in womens so if it is increasing in tempicher then there will be more female then male and that is why that are in danger.
0	I think this claim is true because in Playa the temperature is 85.80 and the turtle is a Female and in Playa the temperature is 80.67 and the turtle is a Male.
0	I think that this is partly true because at  first it is a egg and then it goes into the caterpillar for a long time then it will go into the chrysalis then the last thing of its cycle is it goes into the butterfly and then it will go to its place to migrate but the place will not be to cold or it will not be to worm  it will  be just right for the butterfly to live in the winter time.
0	because the heat goes but it also goes low
1	i think its partly true and partly false because number 1 and  2 are both 85 degrees and one is male and ones female but numbers 19 and 20 is a big different 19 is 80 degrees and its a male and 20 is 86 degrees and a female
1	I think this is true because if you look at the temperatures 84 degrees and up are all females and if you look at the male temperatures they are all 86 and under.
0	i think it is true partly true and partly false because if they are in a really cold environment it probably would affect it when it comes out but it is partly not because when they are in the crystalline it can not affect them as much as when they come out
0	It's false because if you look at the data, there are still some caterpillars that have the same temperature as the ones in the chrysalis's. That means they are in the same temperature as the ones who are growing up faster.
0	i think it is true because it said people reached the butterfly so i think it is true if they said they reached the butterfly mexico it has to be in the right temperature not to warm or to cold.
0	because they just don't just lay girl turtle
0	this is why i think that the answer is true because up in the right corner  it says that in mexico the population stayed about the same.
0	sometimes it might be harder to lay eggs and give birth in colder-weather because it might hurt
0	In the chart to the right in the outside with the crystals is almost the exact same outside with a caterpillar
1	I believe that the claim is partly true and partly false because in some parts it shows that maybe the cooler temperatures can change the affects is has on the life cycles but also the temperature is not really changing the affects because there may be a section where a cooler temperature shows that the life cycle is in the caterpillar form then is switches to a chrysalis but it can then switch back to the caterpillar making me believe it is partly true and partly false.
0	Because I said so
0	Because the temperature is higher.
0	so on my chart i changed it to temp and it shows the colder it is the more likely to become a Caterpillar faster then the hotter places in the hotter places they are still in there chrysalis so it does affect how fast it goes through the life cycle and if i were a butterfly i would want to live in a colder place because i'm impatient.
0	because the report show that the tempiture doesnt really matter
1	I think true because if a monarch butterfly's habitat is cold then it  will not be able to transfer throw out all of the other stages in its life cycle, but if a monarch butterfly's habitat is warm then it will be able to transfer throw the stages. Just like if a human goes out side in the cold then the fluids inside of your body will not stay warm, but if you are inside and it is warm inside then the fluids in your body will keep running faster throw out your body.
0	It is true because from 1993 to 2018 it has stayed very close .The count is off by 9.00 million monarch butterflies.
0	because there all in the 80 to 85 temperature so it cant be because of the temperature. Some of them are almost the same temperatures but there different genders.
1	in 1960 the temperature was 84.56, but in 2016 the temperature is 85.57. it is going just a little higher
0	The monarch butterfly stays in mexico because it likes the heat.
1	In the data if we take the oldest date and the newest date, we will see that the water is accutaully is increasing.
1	As I quickly looked through the location, and went onto temperature where I looked and saw that mainly the monarch butterfly does turn into the chrysalis quicker at hotter temperatures whether inside or outside.
0	i dont know
1	well in 1960 the temp was 84.56 and in 2016 the temp was 85.16 witch is higher but the temp did drop some years but it has clearly gone up
0	I think its true because it depends on the weather.And if is hot or cold 
1	I think that the graf maps it clear that the populaeshun is going down.
0	I think that because the temperature goes higher and lower at all different years. For example, in 1960 the temperature of the sand was 84.56 and in 1962 the temperature was 85.10 which is higher then before.
0	i think  it is false because they don't rush right throw  there life cycle
1	In 1960 the sand temperature was 84.56 and in 2016 the sand temperature was 85.57. So clearly it has not been decreasing it has actually been increasing.
0	I think it is true because different habitats can have an effect on stuff like the food there. not the right food can affect its life stages life, for example, it could be late on becoming a butterfly or like it could be a caterpillar for longer than it should
0	The number of butterfly have continuously been going up and down each year some dropping my the millions but the number is always changing each year making me say that this claim is false and that the number of butterflies has stayed the same each year. the lowest the butterfly population has been was in 2013 and the most is has been was in 1996 the numbers are way different than this author said.
0	it is very important to know understand protect these beautiful  animals
0	I think that the sand temperature in Rain Island has not been decreasing since 1960 because the temperature numbers have just kind of been scattered around after I organized the data by year.
1	I think it is false because the graph shows that it is increasing instead of decreasing.
0	it is true.
0	in 2018 there was 302 and in 1995 there where 630 and in 1996 there was 909 and in 2013 there was 33 so I think that that claim is false.
0	In 2013, the population was 33.50 million, but in 1998, it was almost 30 times that! Not much more to say.
1	according to the chart higher temperatures seem to have female eggs and lower the temperatures seem to have more male. but in the middle of the chart mae and female are a little mixed up.
0	I dont know
0	I think this clam is false, Because well I was reading it said that we have to keep estimating the range, Because more Monarch Butterfly's keep coming to the perfect whether in Mexico to the forest.
0	it take about a were
0	I think it has to do with the turtle population.Because on top of the sand it was warm,But when you dig it gets colder because theirs no sun light but on the other hand when they get played the ones more to the surface they have more light then others and it shows what is the temperature with is just the right to hatch in my option but the ones with less heat still might hatch that why i think it is partly true/partly false
0	yes because i looked at the map type thing and if i'm right it shows the population of the monarch butterfly.the map gives me a good way of seeing the population and im going with that the population is the same now than it was.
1	I think its true because if you look at the data on the chart you can see that male turtles are hatched when the sand temperature is 85.04 and below and the females temperature is  is 85.04 and higher.
0	Because as the data shows from 1996 to 2013 the number of butterfly has gone down a big number. So what clam two is saying is that the numbers has stay the same but looking at the data you can see that is not true.
1	Because some male temps are low that means that females are high temps. But some males are quite high in temps.
0	because it went from 33.50 to 909.50.
1	I think the claim is false because in 1960 the temperature was 84.66 on Rain island. Over 58 years it has increased and decreased but in 2018 it has gone up to 85.67.
0	I think this claim is true because if the temp changes out side the sand changes.
0	butterfly's like the awareness but it does not help them grow does the awareness help us grow we like it like butterfly's it does not help us grow.
0	because it starts from caterpillar to chrysalis, then it ends with a caterpillar not a butterfly.
0	a male was born i 86.54 temp
0	I think its false because of global warming. Global warming would actually make the get go up.
0	I think this claim is true because the butterfly can't be in the cold or high winds unlike a caterpillar that stays on the ground.
0	I think that  it is partly Files cup it lakes a long time to              become a butterfly..
1	I think this claim is true because the caterpillars that were in warmer places have already gone to chrysalis stage. where as the other ones are still in caterpillar stage.
0	because the butterfly has to go places
1	When you sort the data from low to high,you can clearly see that the claim is partly true. On the lower side of the chart, it is only male but in the middle some of the temps. Run up to 85.19 address. Which was uncommon for the sex. With is why only part of the claim is true.
0	i think true because in australia they have rain and sun some times and i think that would affect them in australia
0	because if sea turtles don't have enough sand they can't buried there eggs and if they do predators will get to them.
0	the population has moved around a lot because it has gone all the way from 33.50 to 909.50 and that is a big difference.
0	if you look at sample 6 in 1962 the temperature is at 85.10 but then if you look at sample 27 in 2014 its at 88.18
0	When the years went by the monarch butter flies population goes up little by little. so that means the population did not stay the same.
0	i think that if the temperature where to change the speed of the butterfly's growth then all the factors in the butterfly's life would change the speed of the butterfly growth and its life cycle i think maybe the winter could make them die so that why they go down to other areas such as Mexico and based on the data it says that the chrysalis was in 63 degree weather and that was the top degrees in this hole graph so that shows that the weather doesn't speed the life cycle of the monarch butterfly's.
1	The top of the Life Cycle Stage List where it is colder has all caterpillars and at the bottom of the list where it is hotter has a lot of chrysalis's I think that when it is warmer they go threw their stages faster and when it is colder they go threw their stages slower
0	I put every year in order and then looked at the count (millions). Then, I realized that there were numbers of all different places. Some were higher and some were lower. For example, in 2009, the amount was 96.00 and in 1996, the monarch count was 909.50.
0	in 2008 the temperature is 85.21 but in 2002 the temperature is 86.72
0	I think this is Partly True/Partly False because if you look at 1960 #24 the temperature is 84.56 F. Then in 1968 it decreases #14 to 83.75 F. So far its true but then in 1988 #5 it increases to 85.59 F and it really just keeps this process going over and over.
1	because if it is could the cocoon is cold then it might freeze and when i am outside in the winter i do not see cappella's  or butterfly's. In the summer i think it would be much quicker.
0	because the butterfly make hundreds of more butterfly
0	I know why it would be true, because Where it says claim two,  it says that its decreasing.
1	if you look at the chart you can see that over the years the population has slightly but steadily dropped like in 2013 there was 33.50 million monarchs but in 2014 there was 56.0.
0	The reason why I think it is false is because it can't be true.
1	One reason why I think that is partly true partly false is if that were true then either 1 or 25 would NOT be the same gender as they are because number 1 (85.80) is only .61 hotter than 25 (85.19). I think it is partly true to because the the data shows Females average 85 and a half maybe more and also shows the Males average 84 and a half so that is why I think that it is partly true and partly false.
0	sometimes it did turn into a chrysalis, and sometimes it didn't. Iv'e heard that it depends how much food it has.
0	I think that the  sand tempechure WNT change whether  a sea turtle caches a boy or girl. Because i looked at the data table and saw that mostly  regardless of the  temechure ita an even chance.
1	I think the claim is false because in 1996 the butterfly population is 909.50 million and in 2013 the butterfly population is 33.50 million and there is a big difference in 33.50 million and 909.50 million. So the butterfly population has gone down a lot
0	is all way hot on a land so they have t o adapt to the heat and there in the sand so the egg are kept cold
1	In 1962 the temperature was at 85.10 degrees. and you keep going up in years the temperature goes up and down depending on the weather. In 2008 the temperature was at 85.21. That is a increase if anything in the temperature. it was a 0.11 increase in heat.
1	well most females in the data are born in 85.50 degrees  or more and most males are born below 85.50 degrees. all but 2 females are bore in less 80.50 degrees. and there not 1 male is born in more that 80.50. so its not exactly true but it is party true
0	it is false because i 1960 it was 84.56 degrees, and in 1962 it was 85.10 degrees, so it is not decreasing.
0	you need to start at 1993 and count up till 2018
1	Most of the male eggs are hatched in cooler weather, however most of the female eggs are in a little bit warmer weather
0	Because the numbers on the chart.
0	I think this is false because number 27 is 2014 and 86 degrees and then we look at 1990 its also 86 degrees and then in 2016 its 85 degrees
0	if it was cold it probably not hatch
1	We believe this is false because since 1960 the temperatures have risen.
0	because some eggs need to be incubated and stuff and some dot so maybe the sand can cause it to not you hatch it can take longer
0	because mexico is a relay some stat. they wont be dead.
0	I think its partly true because some of the years the temperature is colder than the other years 2002 is warmer then 2008 and 2010 because they are colder then the later years.
1	Because the monarch butterfly in mexico close to this year is dropping, dropping, and rising, it's never stayed in one place like the tens without bumping up a bit.
1	I think this because if you look at the graph, then you can see that the average of female turtles are born in the warmer temperatures and the male turtles are born in the more cold temperatures.
1	After 11 days there were more chrysalises when it was warmer and more caterpillars as it got colder. So warmer temps make the monarch butterfly's life cycle go faster.
1	why i believe that tempicher effects weather they are male or female because if you look on the cart most male eggs have lower tepicer and female has higher tempicher that is my reason why
0	the change in weather can happen
1	females only hatch above 85 degrees and males hatch at 85 degrees and lower
1	The temperature was higher for females.
1	from different years it goes up and down but It seems that Its increasing than decreasing. In 2002 and up its going up in heat that getting colder in those years so I presently don't  think its decreasing I think its increasing.
0	On the chart after 1960 it sometimes get higher and sometimes lower.
0	The data shows the caterpillars are turning into chrysalis at certain temperatures without supplying anymore info. How much did they eat? What did they eat? Where did they live? When did they eat? Were they sick? There's a lot more that we would need to know in order to tell. There are indoor caterpillars that turned in to chrysalis, but outdoor caterpillars, too. For all we know, the outdoor ones could be more productive out in the wild, and the indoor ones may just be fed and lazy.
0	I think this claim is wrong because in 1993 the population of monarch butterflies were at 311.50 million. But by 2003, the population has risen to 556.00 million. And by 2018 it went back down to 302.50. This is why I think the claim is false.
0	The count in millions has changed a lot
0	i think its false because it said that they hatch in the sand and go find safety in the sea they don't  say anything about having a special feature.
0	This is shipping because of the forest fires and polotchiponthat has been happening for years
0	i think this because the temperature is going down and then going right back to the temperature it was at before.
1	I think that it partially matters what temperature it is for a monarch butterfly to effect how fast it's life cycle goes because when i was looking at the data i noticed that if the temperature was over or at 60.48 then it was more likely to be in a chrysalis.
0	its false because we don't have enough information.
0	because in the 1990s there was maybe half 84 and half 85 but in the 2000s it is  more 84 than 85 I sorted it by year so I could see the difference between years in order I just checked if it was not just the 2000s they were talking about but it did not matter.
1	I know the temperature of the monarch butterfly's habitat affects how quickly it goes through its life cycle stages is because when I sort the data by cold to hot and most of the hot temperature was the chrysalis meaning they do better in hot places
0	i think it is false because the sand cant get colder only the water can
0	I think it is partly true partly false because some butter fly were made from the cocoon and sme had to die off so i dont know if it is true or false.
0	because when my uncle was in the coast caused  had to practice scuba diving and when he did did they boat like a almost 100 year old turtle in i think i said i think to do something with it he never told me what he did with the turtle
1	The claim is false because I sorted it lowest to highest temperature and the caterpillars was yes, all in one group, but they kept going back 'n' forth. Caterpillar, chrysalis, then back to caterpillars. So therefore the caterpillars will form into papa at different rates in different temperature, however, it changes groups in the same temperature!For instance, 59.36 is in the caterpillar bunch, but, the papa is in 59.54.So maybe temperatures could support faster growth, however, due to the continuous changing i believe that this statement is also incorrect. That is why the statement is partly true, and partly false.
0	It has not been decreasing because it got higher.
1	if it is warm out it will change faster than if it is cold
1	84.20 and up is almost all female
1	I think this claim is partly true because most of the the ones in the 60's are chrysalises and most of the 50's are not
0	because in 1960 the sand temperature was 84.56 and in and in 1972 it was 84.20
0	I think it is false because the turtle born in Playa for example is a female that was born at a temperature of 85.80 degrees Fahrenheit and one of the males born in Playa is 84.98. There is also males, and females born in Surname that are almost exactly the same temperature when they were born. In conclusion that is why i think that The sand temperature doesn't affect whether leatherback eggs hatch as a male or female.   p
0	It's True because it is the same thing but their are a little difference. They almost have the same patterns.
0	I think it is because if its cold the butterfly might freeze and if they are warm they will have a longer lifespan and they migrate so if the to some place warm and the temperature changes they might die
1	i think it's false because it says they started tracking in 1993 and from 1993 to 2013 the population has gone down instead of staying the same it went from 909 million to 33 million.This is why i think that the monarch butterfly's population didn't stay the same.
1	Some males where  born in hot texture same as females. It goes back and forth to say the heat affects the gender, if you say that  the hotter sand has females you would problem wrong  next time some males where born in high texture  thats why its problem false.
0	I don't think that the temperature affects there gender because they were already made in the costume of the turtle. So if I was in my moms costume and it was hot I don't think that would affect my gender. But this is a hole different animal. But its not able to switch its gender.A mom cant just say i want a girl. that's not possible.
0	The report dos not say it decreases.
0	I think this clam is true, Because in the story it says the Monarch Butterfly's temperature affects how quickly it goes through its life cycle stages.
0	In my graph since the year 1993 it has rapidly increased, rapidly decreased, and mediocrity decreased. Which is the exact opposite of the scientists claims.
1	The claim is false because in 1996 their where 909.5 million butterfly's in Mexico. But in 2008 the butterfly population has gone down to 253 million and it decreased from there. Until 2013 where there was only 33.5 million butterfly's in Mexico so it is pretty obvious that the claim is false because the butterfly population went down 876 million in 17 years.
0	I think this is true because the data table shows that the temperature was decreasing lower and lower each time they tested it.
0	I think this claim is partly true because mostly a lot of females make it to Mexico to lay eggs when they hatch the females die. That wouldn't make the population of butterflies be exactly the same. The females lay several eggs witch would make more not the same. It is almost rare for butterflies to make it back from Mexico because of the weather or they die in Mexico.
0	I think it doesn't mater
0	I think it is false because if an egg is laying playa sand it can come out as a female or male because if you look at the chart and look at what gender is next to playa sand it will say either female or male, not just male, not not just female. Same to do with the Surname sand.
0	I think this claim is false because as you can tell with the years sorted in this order, you can see how the temperatures go up, down, up, down.  I notes that toward the end in the parts the temp raised! I think it's safe to say this claim is false. on the chart, the green circle represents the temp dropping and the blue circle represents the temp rising. these are just two examples of this.
0	because It's mostly the same temperature.
0	It is false because the sand temperature keeps on going to 84 to 85. It starts at 84 then went up to 85 in 2016 so it's going up and not down.
0	I think its true because in colder weather, monarch butterflies usually go inside where it warmer but when  monarch butterflies are in warmer weather they tend to go outside because it would be way warmer than the colder times.
0	on the chart it shows that the temperature has decreased and in crested over time making this evidence true
0	Because it is true
1	If you look at the temperatures from lowest to highest, you see that all the lowest temperatures say caterpillar and the higher temperatures say chrysalis. This shows that the temperature of the habitat affects how quickly monarch butterfly's life cycle stages change.
0	If your looking at the chart, all the temperatures are around 83,85, and 84. Which means they haven't been decreasing at all.
0	its partly true because sea turtles do lay there eggs in the sand its partly false because the sand temperature does not help the eggs hatch into a boy or a girl
0	
0	if its cold or if its a bigger egg it will hatch more slow if its a bigger or more cold cattipiler will stay in to keep worm
0	I think its wrong because there are similar temperatures and some die as a caterpillar and some die in a chrysalis. for example, there is one where it's 60.90 and it dies as a caterpillar then there's one where its 60.98 and it dies as a chrysalis.
1	i think this claim is false because the data table shows that as years go on the population have been increasing and decreasing. Also thats happening because butterflies go there when it gets to cold or to hot where they live and it degrees when they leave to go somewhere else.
0	if you look at 1,2,and 3 the first is female and the temperature is at 85.80 and then the second one is male the temperature for that one is 85.04 but if you look at the third its female but the temperature is 84.77 which is colder than the males
0	because the temperature is the same all the time or in the same range or temp.
1	In 1960 the temperature was 84.56 and the temperature kept getting higher not decreasing.
0	I think it is true because if this butterfly went some where really cold then i think it would affect how quickly it goes through their stages.
1	when you go to the 1960 the temps were 84 and when you go to dates higher up you see the actually increase
0	i think it is true because if there cocoon is frozen then they can't be changing and there stages of becoming a butterfly.That's why i think the temperature matters in a butterfly's habitat.
0	it is the same speed going throne life size.
1	I think the sand temperature affects whether leatherback eggs hatch as a male or a female. I think that because on the data the warmest sand had mostly females and the cooler the sand got the more males there was. The warmest sand a male was hatched in was 85.19. The coolest a female egg hatched was 84.20. That is why sand temperature affects whether leatherback eggs are female or male.
0	The years are going up and the temperature is not getting warmer or colder it is staying in the 83.0-87.0 range
0	because some butterfly's moved to other places in the world they did not just stay in one place.
1	I think this claim is false because as the years go on the temperatures are not staying about the same. Sometimes one year is millions more than the other. Through out the year it has gone up and down with less millions and more millions. So I believe this claim is false.
0	I think this is false because the count goes from like 90 to 400 to 30.  On the graph it goes from 50 to 200 to 900.  900 is the most.  If it stayed the same most of the data would be in a line.
1	yes because of its temporal is raising.
0	they went up 1 or 2 but some went down 1
0	because it said it in the reading
0	so they know what they are doing
0	they lee for winter
1	My claim is that the temperature that a chrysalis is in depends on how fast it grows into an adult because, if the temperature is 50 that is not normal for a butterfly to grow in the average temperature is around 60 degrees Fahrenheit. So if it was 50 degrees it would be below what they are used to so it would grow slower.
0	Because if its cold the monarch will die because it does not have much fat on it so if will freeze to death
0	Claim: My claim is that the temperature of the sea turtles eggs doesnt affect the gender. Evidence: In the data it doesn't neccarsily show weather or not the it makes a different of the gender on the types of sea turtles. For example the lowest temperature. The highest temperature is 88.8 which is a female. The lowest temperature is 80.60 which is a male. Also in the data all the temperatures are mixed around it doesnt show anything like females are always hotter and males are colder and vice versa.Reasoning: That is the reasoning why i do not think that the temperature of the egg in the sand does not impact the gender of the sea turtle.
0	It says the sand temperature affects whether leatherback eggs hatch as male or female, but scientists figure out when they hatched.
0	The temp goes up by a degree and then one year it will go down by a degree.
0	this claim is false because in 1993 the count is about 311 million and in 2011 the count is about 144 million and that's a pretty big difference.
1	all the females are at a higher tem like 85 butt the males are lower like 80 but some males are at 85 too and some females are as low as 84
0	The Sea turtles, male or female, are born at a temperature of 80 to 90 degrees F.
0	i thin that is true because that is wat the data said and thats the soul of life for a outer fly
1	because when in the higher temperatures the insect is mostly in the caterpillar stage and when it's in the lower temp they're mostly in the chrysalis stage but in some parts of the table that is not true.
0	because each year more go to Mexico because it's warm in Mexico.
0	there are no other reasons
0	Because when it's a girl the temperature is in the 80's and when its a boy the temperature is in the 80's too.
0	Because you have to know the butterfly's temperature if you are going to learn about them
0	because they go to mexico in winter
1	The highest count of butterfly was in 1996 and ever since then it has dropped rapidly over the past 17 years. And it has dropped by over 800 million, so it has not been staying the same.
0	The temperatures have not been decreasing they have been staying around 85 degrees the coldest its been there is 84 degrees.
1	The reason why I think it is false is because it the data there is about the same amount of male and female turtles in each location. I also think this because in the data there is not much proof that the temperature affects the gender of the turtle.
0	If you put the temperature from lowest to highest and look at the male/  female called, the low temperature is female, and the male is in the high temperature.
1	The higher temperature are mostly female and the lower temperature are mostly male. I said partly true partly false because some male sea turtles are high temperatures and some female sea turtles are in the lower temperatures.
0	because if the temperature change  will efeckit and it will not think it is clam.
0	some caterpillar's and chrysalis live in the same location and some are growing faster than others
0	I think it is kinda true that the population has stayed the same because in the summer i haven't seen alot of them but, their could be alot and i just don't see them so i think it is kinda true and kinda not true.
0	I think it is partly true/ partly false. I think this  if you look at the data, it will go back and fourth between chrysalis and caterpillar. Right in the middle of the data it goes back and fourth. there will sometimes be a caterpillar in the beginning. I believe that it could help to study the location of the butter fly. and if it is inside or outside a building/structure.
0	I think its partly true and partly false Because, it depends where they are like if there  Africa i could be jest right or too hot or in Maine it could be to cold that's why they go away for the winter. They go the warmer limits when there limit is too cold. That's why I think its partly true and partly false.
1	the population of monarch butterflies has severely gone down from 1996 to 2013
0	I think that it may be true because the highest temperature was a female and the lowest temperatures were all male. But i'm not positive all of the way because when the temperature got to around 84 degrees, it switched into like a pattern of male female male female female and then went onto the rest of the temps witch were only male.
0	I think it's partly true and partly false because there are some caterpillars that have not became a chrysalis in the same temperature as the caterpillars that have already became chrysalis.
0	I dont know
0	Different butterflies are at different stages and the temperature  has nothing to do with how fast the butterfly goes through the stages of its life.
0	so the temp. helps but not to hot
0	This is true because
0	id bryan bryan bryan bryan bryan bryan bryan bryan bryan bryan bryan bryan bryan bryan
1	when the caterpillar is in his chrysalis stage it is hotel but when it is in its normal stage it is ship less worm [OT: graded out rows already coded in Feb13 file]
0	there wore more boys than girls but  they were pretty close the same amount so that's why I said it was partly true and partly false
1	I found that the butterflies grow more in warmer weather.   The butterflies in 54 degrees were still in the caterpillar stage.  But in the 62 degree range they were in the chrysalis stage.  That shows they grew more.
0	ID
0	I think is's false from 1996 the was 909.50 million butterflies going to Mexico compared 2018 with 302.50 million to 2013 with only 33.50
0	i think that it is ministre but false
0	the go throw stages and the winter that are they miller mills from that nachrol habitat
0	because all female turtles lay their eggs on the beach and then she leaves them
0	because some places sand and stuff can be a different but id if has been changing
0	you got to save the travel
0	The numbers of the butterfly is not the same
0	I believe the claim is false because in my graph the temperature has shown increase from the year 1960.
1	Why I think it is false is pretty simple. If you look at the table or diagram then it shows in 1960 the temputare of the sand was 84.56 degrees F. And then go 2014 the temputuare is 86.16 degrees F. So that would lead me to believe that the temputuare of the sand is increasing not decreasing.
0	I think the turtles are letter back because there are different to other  times of anamules
0	I think this claim is false because there is a lot of variety each year. for example in 2009 there were 96 million butterflies and in 2010 there were 201 million butterflies.
0	i think that because they can both be man or female
1	Look at 1968, 83.75 degrees, and then look at 2016, 85.57 degrees the temperature goes higher not lower.
1	I am seeing that the life cycle In affected by the temp. of their habitat.Some evidence that my claim is true is that 60 Degrees *f is when they start turning in to caterpillars but over 60 is chryalises.
0	yes because 50 50
0	I think its false because male and female turtles were being born in 85 degrees.The same goes for 84 degrees.
0	no they are not because other monarch butterfly are migrating there.
0	It's not about the sand temperature it's about if their genes are stronger and their genes determine what gender they are.
0	it changed a lot and they were in all kinds of places
0	true because everything ranges from 0 to 900
0	I believe that the claim is false because on the chart in 1960 the temp.was 84.56 and the other years have had a lower temp.And other years the temp. has been higher.
0	the monarch population staying the same is false because looking at my data, the numbers are nowhere near eachother
1	Yes this is true because I sorted the temps from low to high, and on average the lower temps were all male hatching. and the high temps were all female, so yes there is a correlation between sand temperature and the the gender of the eggs of leatherback turtles.
1	Every chrysalis tested had a temperature between 59 degrees and 63 degrees. The majority of  the chrysalises were inside.Every caterpillar tested was between 54 and 60 degrees. Most caterpillars were outside. the locations for both were very close between more inside or more outside. Overall, I think it is partially true is because it is true, but the difference in temperature ranges was very small and might not mean anything. Also, the location may or may not have made a difference.
0	the temperature of  the sand in rain island,Australia has been  decreasing since 1960.
1	I think its partly true/ partly false because in some parts it's colder than the warm temperature and it still said chrysalis.
0	vanessa
1	I think this question is true because when the temperatures are getting warmer there are lots of chrysalis'. But when it is a little colder out there are mostly caterpillars.
1	because most of the time there are male and female sometimes there are just female and sometimes the a just males because male need to be colder to the ground or the won't be a male they will then be a female. female need to be warmer than the males if there to cold they will most likely to be a male
0	3 males were born in very hot sand and 2 females were born in coldsand
0	Because the temperature has been going up and down since 1960-2016.
1	As you can see in the data...over the years the butterfly population in Mexico has changed. There were way more butterflies in the 90's. in the 2000's the numbers died down , but in the early and late 2010's it slowly started rising again.
0	because it was in the reading!!!!!
0	i dont know
0	All of the facts that were included in this text had great details. I think temperature does effect how fast the monarchs go through their life cycle. I think this because if they get to cold when they are in their chrysalis they can freeze on the inside and not grow. Also, if it is too hot for the caterpillar in it's chrysalis it would probably kill them and cause them to not grow anymore.
0	the temperature is always within 2 degrees
0	because if it is cold the babies will die
0	It is false because in 2002 it was 86.72 and in 2008 it was 15.21 but in 1964 it was 84.56
0	its more worm down in mexico
0	I think it's partly true because it shows that inside they are mostly still chrysalis and outside its more of caterpillars
0	I think this is false because in 1960 the temperature was 84.56 and the the temperature in 1962 was 85.10 so its been going up not down.
1	up high has mostly chrysalis and down below is all catapilar starting at sample number 3, inside, 59.36 degrees. however there are a few catapilars up above too.
0	it has mostly changed
0	They have not stayed the same since scientists started keeping track. They actually have decreased by over 300 million the first year and then over 20 million the last year
0	If you look at the chart the year 1960 is lowest but then it is increasing not decreasing so I think that claim 2 is false.
0	Yes, because if you look at the temperature it is going down and down more.
1	i think is is true because the lowest for males to spawn is 80.60 temp and the lowest for females is 84.20 temp so the hotter the sand it will be a female the colder the sand is it going to be a male and that's why the sand temperature affects if it's a male or female
0	because for some reason the heat makes the gender different and the turtles know this so they place their eggs in different places accordingly.
0	I think claim 2 is false because the population is going up a lot and is almost up to 1000 so i so not think claim 2 is telling the truth.
0	it keeps the eggs warm
