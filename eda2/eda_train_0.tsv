0	i think the first claim is partially right and partially legal injury because if you look at the data close adequate you will see that the highest temperature is and the life cycle present is a chrysalis and as the temperature goes down you see that the life cycle present has change into a caterpillar so the life cycle of present of the butterflies is taking a bit retentive
0	i think the first claim is partly right and partly wrong because if you look at the data close enough you will see that the highest temperature is and the life cycle stage is a chrysalis and as the temperature goes down you see that the life cycle stage has changed into a caterpillar so the life cycle of stage of the butterflies is taking a bit longer

0	i think it is false because if an egg is laying playa sand it can come out as a female eggs or male atomic number because if you look at the chart and look at what cognomen gender is next to playa sand it descend will say either female or male not just male not not just beaver state female same to beaver state do with the surname sand

0	round i think this claim is false because as you can tell with the atomic number years sorted in off key this order you can see how the temperatures go up down up down i notes that toward the end in the title parts the temp raised i conceive think its safe to represent say this claim is false on the chart the green circle represents the temp dropping and the atomic number blue circle represents the temp rising these are just two examples of this

0	because the mostly its same temperature
0	because its mostly the same temperature 
0	it is false because the sand temperature keeps on going to it starts at then went up to in so its going up and not down
0	it is false because the sand temperature keeps on going to to it starts at then went up to in so its going up and not down 
0	i to its true because in colder weather monarch butterflies usually colder inside where it warmer but when be butterflies are in warmer weather they tend think go outside because it would monarch way warmer than the go times
0	i think its true because in colder weather monarch butterflies usually go inside where it warmer but when monarch butterflies are in warmer weather they tend to go outside because it would be way warmer than the colder times 
0	on the chart it shows that the temperature has decreased and in crested over time making this evidence admittedly
0	on the chart it shows that the temperature has decreased and in crested over time making this evidence true
0	because it is true up
0	because it is true
0	if your looking at the chart all the are around and which means they havent been decreasing at all
0	if your looking at the chart all the temperatures are around and which means they havent been decreasing at all 
0	its partly true because sea turtles do lay there ball in the sand its partly false because the sand temperature does not assistance the ball hachure into a boy or a girl
0	its partly true because sea turtles do lay there eggs in the sand its partly false because the sand temperature does not help the eggs hatch into a boy or a girl
0	?
0	I think this is false because in 1960 the temperature was 84.56 and the the temperature in 1962 was 85.10 so its been going up not down.
0	it has mostly changed
0	They have not stayed the same since scientists started keeping track. They actually have decreased by over 300 million the first year and then over 20 million the last year
0	If you look at the chart the year 1960 is lowest but then it is increasing not decreasing so I think that claim 2 is false.
0	Yes, because if you look at the temperature it is going down and down more.
0	because for some reason the heat makes the gender different and the turtles know this so they place their eggs in different places accordingly.
0	I think claim 2 is false because the population is going up a lot and is almost up to 1000 so i so not think claim 2 is telling the truth.
0	it keeps the eggs warm
