10375104,10,1,0,Female or Male they go to warm places where temperature go up to 80 degrees. They always go to warmer places
10375104,10,2,1,"Look at 1968, 83.75 degrees, and then look at 2016, 85.57 degrees the temperature goes higher not lower."
10375114,0,1,0,"I think this clam is true, Because in the story it says the Monarch Butterfly's temperature affects how quickly it goes through its life cycle stages."
10375114,0,2,0,"I think this clam is false, Because well I was reading it said that we have to keep estamating the range, Because more Monarch Butterfly's keep coming to the perfecht wether in Mexico to the forest."
10375116,0,1,0,"I think that the temperature effects how quickly it goes threw its life cycle stages partly true/partly false. Because when it is inside it has no place to do its stages and its temperature is to high or low. Also, It is different when its a chrysalis because, whether inside or outside its about the same temperature either way."
10375116,0,2,1,"I think it is false because through the years the population has gone down 100's. For example the population has gone down 876.000 (876 hundredths), from 909.50 to only 33.50. So that is why I think that it is false."
10375123,0,1,1,because if it is could the cocoon is cold then it might freeze and when i am outside in the winter i do not see catpellar's  or butterfly's. In the summer i think it would be much qucker.
10375123,0,2,0,because some butterfly's moved to other places in the world they did not just stay in one place.
10375131,0,1,1,I think the claim is true because outside it is 56.84 degrees  and the butterfly is in the caterpillar stage. The other one says that it is 59.54 degrees and the butterfly in in it's chrysallis stage.
10375131,0,2,1,I think the claim is false because in 1996 the butterfly population is 909.50 million and in 2013 the butterfly population is 33.50 million and there is a big difference in 33.50 million and 909.50 million. So the butterfly population has gone down a lot
10375146,10,1,1,I think this claim is true because all the females numbers are within a couple of numbers of each other. And it is the same for male.\n\nI think this because in the data it says on one piece of evidence that it was 85.82 degress and it was a female then another one said 85.54 and that was a female. \n\nanother reason i think this is because in the data it says 80.56 and it was a male then another one said 80.60 and that was a male to.\n\nin conclusion I think claim 1 is true.\n\n
10375146,10,2,0,I think this claim is false. I think that because it is all around the same number. \n\nI think that because in almost all the numbers are 85 degress  for exsample 17 out of 29 are 85 degress. \n\nAnother reason I think this is because the temperture goes down by like 1 degree and then it goes back up. for example it goes down to 84 degress and then goes back up to 85 degress.\n\nin conclusion i think this claim is false
10375155,0,1,0,I think this claim is partly true partly false because it has to be a certain temperture for a cryselis to form.
10375155,0,2,0,"I think this claim is false because the populatoin has not stayed the same, this is because as the years increase the butterfly number increases to.for example in 1996 there were 33.50 million and fast forward to 2003 there were 556.00 and it just keeps droping and soon there will be no butterflies."
10375160,10,1,1,I think this claim is true because whether sea turtles lay there eggs in the sand and the different temperatures that effect in there eggs shell could change there formation of themselves. To turn into to a male or female. Also I notice that the temperatures stay in the eighties maybe  that also has something to do with it. Males usually in Suriname tend to stat around in under the 85's but females on the other hand stay above an 85 maybe that's a reason the come out male or female.\n
10375160,10,2,0,I think its true because it depends on the weather.And if is hot or cold \n
10375174,0,1,1,Most of the chrysalis temperatures are 60 degrees and over plus maybe the temperatures have something to do with their migration because the text did say that they preffered lukewarm temperature
10375174,0,2,1,The chart clearly shows the population decrease from 909 million to 33 million and maybe it is due to natural causes or something happened  on the way
10375176,10,1,0,"I think it has to do with the turtle population.Because on top of the sand it was warm,But when you dig it gets colder because theirs no sun light but on the other hand when they get layed the ones more to the surface they have more light then others and it shows what is the temperature with is just the right to hatch in my option but the ones with less heat still might hatch that why i think it is partly true/partly false"
10375176,10,2,0,I think that is partly true and partly false because overtime in 1960 the temperature was 84 degrees it did get hotter but it did call down sometime but golble warming witch is making the weather warmer also it goes down and up so i guess it is kind of the same
10375180,10,1,1,I think that this is true because mostly the females are born in hotter sands but all the temputaures are close together which would make me conclude that it would be true. Climate change might over populate the sea turles because if more femals are born in hotter snads that there is going to be a lot more female sea turtles to lay there eggs. This could also impact the population in a different way. That way being there would be not enough males so they could not mate. So that would make the population drop.
10375180,10,2,1,Why I think it is false is pretty simple. If you look at the table or digram then it shows in 1960 the temputare of the sand was 84.56 degrees F. And then go 2014 the temputuare is 86.16 degrees F. So that would lead me to believe that the temputuare of the sand is increasing not decreasing.
10375182,0,1,0,"I think its true because in colder weathers, monarch butterflies usually go inside where it warmer but when  monarch butterflies are in warmer weather they tend to go outside because it would be way warmer than the colder times."
10375182,0,2,0,I think its false because every year its grows to more counts  but in the claim it said the populations stayed the same every year.
10375188,0,1,0,I think that this is partly true because at  first it is a egg and then it goes into the caterpillar for a long time then it will go into the chrysalis then the last thing of its cycle is it goes into the butterfly and then it will go to its place to migrate but the place will not be to clod or it will not be to worm  it will  be just right for the butterfly to live in the winter time.
10375188,0,2,0,"I think this is true because in the winter time when they go to hibernate I think that most of all butterfly""s go to mexico because it is the most right temperature for the butterfly\'s to stay at mexico longer in the winter."
10375190,10,1,0,I think it doesn't mater
10375190,10,2,0,every time in two years the temperature was in between 84-86

14546105,10,2,0,the article said so
14546112,10,1,0,"The Sea turtles, male or female, are born at a temperature of 80 to 90 degrees F."
14546112,10,2,0,The Heights of sand go up and down through the years\n
14546125,0,1,0,I think it's partly true because it shows that inside they are mostly still chrysalis and outside its more of caterpillars

14546159,10,1,0,"I believe that the temperature can maybe change if it is a male or female, but I don't really know.  Some of the results say record that there were 4 males or females in a row at the same place wich there temperatures would be different in different places, but they also show in some sections that they can be scattered (one female one day a male a different day). But on the other hand, a female lays there eggs all together in the same place under the sand so the temperature would be very close in the same hole and there are different genders in one hole.  So I think that it can be true or false."
14546159,10,2,0,"The temperature has been mostly the same when you look at the data, so obviously, it wouldn't be decreasing over the years."
14546164,10,1,0,i dont know
14546164,10,2,0,i dont know\n
14546176,0,1,0,The temperatures are not that different. They are all in the high 50s/low 60s. The majority is the caterpillar even though the temperatures at least 1 degree apart. But then again a few degrees can make a difference depending on the study.
14546176,0,2,1,"The population went down almost 900 million in only 17 years. The butterfly population went down 13 million in one year. Therefore, the population is going down rapidly!"
14546180,10,1,1,"The graph provided with the investigation shows that commonly the higher temperature sands normally have hatching female turtles unlike hatching male turtles that do their thing in colder sands. Now in the graph, some male turtles hatch in warmer sands than female hatching turtles but not as often as the other way around. I still stick with my decision with true with my reasons conveniently said and the graph for evidence"
14546180,10,2,0,I think the scientists are wrong the sands are not going down in temperature and the graph provides the evidence to support. Yes by the graph the sands go up and down every recorded time like it can go up then it can go down then back up then down but the last one is back up which supports my stupid claim\n
14546182,0,1,0,"Most of the monarchs are still caterpillars because it takes a long time to create a chrysalis,and since it takes long to make a chrysalis it is partly true.But if we did the same but with only chrysalis we will see that its just in the middle."

14546202,0,1,0,If the monarch butterfly goes through the stages fast then it's probably used to doing something fast and not having the patients to do stuff so that's probably one of it's habit
14546202,0,2,0,no they are not because other monarch butterfly are migrating there.
14546206,0,1,1,"i think that this is partly true because the article said that the weather cant be too cold and cant be to warm. i think this could affect how they grow, if the monarch butterfly are in too warm of weather they could not grow properly. if they are in too clod of weather they could take longer to grow, or even worst die. i do agree that it can cause them to to grow. if monarch butterfly are in to warm or harsh weather it could cause the population to go down in stead of up. that is why i think climate can cause butterfly to not grow."
14546206,0,2,0,"i think this claim is false because, you can see in  1996 there were 909.50 monarch butterfly a year. now in 2013 there are only 33.50 that is a big difference. its because of the weather and global warming. that is why i think that claim is false. i am not saying they are  wrong but i am giving my thoughts and telling them why i think that."
14546207,10,1,1,"In the graph, you can see many of the females were found in Playa and many of the males in Suriname. The temperature for the females is mostly high ranging from 88-84. From this, we can make the claim that females spawn in warmer climates. As the males spawn in cooler areas."
14546207,10,2,0,"As seen in the chart sample one is shown the highest. If you look underneath it you can see sample number 27 and 26. This shows that the climate of the island has not changed very much. Yes, the last test is showed low but most of the other tests show high temperatures."
14546209,0,1,0,the temperature does affect the life cycle of butterflies according to the evidence on the table.
14546209,0,2,1,the population of monarch butterflies has severely gone down from 1996 to 2013
14546221,0,1,0,i think it is true partly true and partly false because if they are in a really cold environment it probably would affect it when it comes out but it is partly not because when they are in the crystallites it can not affect them as much as when they come out
14546221,0,2,0,it is partly true and partly false because it has gone up and done in the different years it has changed over all the years it has gone up and down
14546227,10,1,1,"i believe that the sand can affect the gender some times because in the data that shows has the highest temperatures on top with the lowest on bottom and almost all of the high temps are female rather than male one of the highest temps is 88.08 and is female as well as 87.09, 86.97, 86.54, 86.26, those are the highest temps and they are all female the lowest temperature of the female in this test is 84.20 but most of the males is 83.31, 83.25, 82.45, 82.29, the highest of the males in this test is 85.19 quite low to the female turtles. I did say that this thought was partly true/partly false for these reasons"
14546227,10,2,1,This thought is partly true/partly false because the sand in the 1960's through the 1982's these years had the lowest temps in theses years all the other years above that mostly are higher numbers\n
14546230,10,1,1,because in the hotter temperature the female eggs hatched
14546230,10,2,0,the change in weather can happen
14546246,0,1,0,"I think its wrong because there are similar temperatures and some die as a caterpillar and some die in a chrysalis. for example, there is one where it's 60.90 and it dies as a caterpillar then there's one where its 60.98 and it dies as a chrysalis."
14546246,0,2,0,I think is's false from 1996 the was 909.50 million butterflies going to Mexico compared 2018 with 302.50 million to 2013 with only 33.50
14546250,0,1,0,I believe that the temperature of the monarchs habitats does not depend on the monarchs habitat temperature. The reason that it doesn't depend on the  temperature is because the results vary between inside and outside of the temperature of the chrysalis. One of the temperature for the chrysalis is 59.54 Fahrenheit  and another is 63.14 Fahrenheit that is a 4 degree difference. Also the colder one is outside and  the hotter one is inside. That's why i Believe that the temperature does not matter for a monarch caterpillar to turn into a chrysalis.
14546250,0,2,0,False because on the graph the numbers change depending on the years. because 1996 the butterfly rate was really hi and in 2013 it was really low.
14546256,10,1,0,because the  evidence shows that the temperature is in the 80s so the sand has to be in the 80s to be hatched
14546256,10,2,0,i think this because the temperature is going down and then going right back to the temperature it was at before.
14546260,0,1,1,I think this is fales because most of the higher the tepitures are still in the chrysallis stage
14546260,0,2,0,i think this is false because the evedace shows the number of butter go up\n
14546262,10,1,0,it shows that really no matter what temp it is that any male or female can hatch
14546262,10,2,1,well in 1960 the temp was 84.56 and in 2016 the temp was 85.16 witch is higher but the temp did drop some years but it has clearly gone up
14546263,10,1,0,"I believe this claim is false. I believe it to be false because in the graph you can clearly see there is nearly an equivalent amount of male and female leatherback hatchlings. In addition, they are hatched in the same temperature range of about 80 to 85 Fahrenheit."
14546263,10,2,0,"This claim is false because there is barely a decline in temperature. If you were to say that there is a decline you would need to know it only drops down 1 degree every few years. In the graph, you can see that in 2000,1994, 1992, 1974, 1988, and 1962, it stays 85 degrees Fahrenheit."
14546287,0,1,0,sample #7 is almost the exact same tep as #60
14546287,0,2,0,the numbers ether drop or raise depending on the year

14546293,10,1,0,\nthe sands temperature in the ocean shore affects if  it will be a boy or a girl who will hatch from the   turtles egg.
14546293,10,2,0,"the temperature of  the sand in raine island,Australia has been  decreasing since 1960."
14816104,10,1,0,i think it is false because under the sand the temp is the same even when it is colder abouve ground\n
14816104,10,2,0,i think it is false because the sand cant get colder anly the water can
14816107,0,1,0,i thin that is true becaus that is wat the data said and thats the srcul of life for a buter fliy
14816107,0,2,0,i think thay can not fliy that fast to my grat thay are spostohibrnat in a ckon
14816112,10,1,1,in the lower tempature there are mainly males till 84.20 then it is mixed till 85.42 where the rest are al female
14816112,10,2,0,because in 1960 the tempature was 84.56 in 1994 the tempature was 85.57 as so in 2016
14816114,10,1,1,when it is the warmer climates the eggs are female and when the climates are below 85  they are male
14816114,10,2,1,when you go to the 1960 the temps were 84 and when you go to dates higher up you see the actually increase
14816116,10,1,0,"I think it is false because if an egg is laying playa sand it can come out as a female or male because if you look at the chart and look at what gender is next to playa sand it will say either female or male, not just male, not not just female. Same to do with the Suriname sand."
14816116,10,2,1,"I think it is false because if you look at the temperature in 1960 it is lower than in 2016, so than means that the temperature is not decreasing, that means that the temperature is increasing from 1960 to 2016."
14816119,10,1,1,"The sand temperature affects whether leather-back eggs hatch as male or female because scientific research proves that when the eggs have been laid in warmer sand, the turtle is a female. When the egg is laid in cooler sand, the turtle is a male. Also, These turtles have been laid in different locations. So we know that in Playa the turtles don't tend to be female. That part is totally random. The Male and Female's were both scattered around Playa and Suriname."
14816119,10,2,1,"Some are saying that the temperature of the sand in Raine Island, Australia has been decreasing since 1960. This information is incorrect. As I have made my graph of data that has been collected from the past years, I have found that the temperatures have gone up since 1960, not gone down."
14816133,10,1,0,is all way hot on a iland so they have t o udapt to the heat and there in the sand so the egg are cept cold
14816133,10,2,1,i think it false because of climit chang it get hoter and hoter.
14816142,0,1,0,i think that if the temperature where to change the speed of the butterfly's growth then all the factors in the butterfly's life would change the speed of the butterfly growth and its life cycle i think maybe the winter could make them die so that why they go down to other areas such as Mexico and based on the data it says that the chrysalis was in 63 degree weather and that was the top degrees in this hole graph so that shows that the weather doesn't speed the life cycle of the monarch butterfly's.
14816142,0,2,0,The reason i said it was partly true was because 2006 2005 2007 where about the same but years like 2018 2017 are not the same at all.
14816146,0,1,0,I think this claim is true because if its cold the butterflies are gonna want to be in their Chrysalis. Like when you are cold you wouldn't want to be outside in the cold you want to be raped up in your blanket cause its warmer.
14816146,0,2,1,I think this statement is false because butterflies dies in a quick amount of time they don't stay around for 17 years and the data on the chart has different numbers leading up to 2013 as you can see it has gone down.
14816149,10,1,0,I thinks it is true because a Leather back  can have male or female. some male and female have temper in there body that makes it feel warm or cold.
14816149,10,2,0,"I think it would be partly true and partly false because the temperature of the sand and rain   island , Australia BUT IT THINK IT PROBALEY WOULD BE TRUE"
14816155,0,1,1,I believe that the claim is partly true and partly false because in some parts it shows that maybe the cooler temperatures can change the affects is has on the life cycles but also the temperature is not really changing the affects because there may be a section where a cooler temperature shows that the life cycle is in the caterpillar form then is switches to a chrysalis but it can then switch back to the caterpillar making me believe it is partly true and partly false.
14816155,0,2,0,The number of butterfly have continuously been going up and down each year some dropping my the millions but the number is always changing each year making me say that this claim is false and that the number of butterflies has stayed the same each year. the lowest the butterfly population has been was in 2013 and the most is has been was in 1996 the numbers are way different than this author said.
14816159,0,1,1,I think that it partially matters what temperature it is for a monarch butterfly to effect how fast it's life cycle goes because when i was looking at the data i noticed that if the temperature was over or at 60.48 then it was more likely to be in a chrysalis.
14816159,0,2,0,I think that this claim is false because when i was looking at the data for butterfly population I lined up the years from least to greatest and i started at the year 1993 because that's when scientists started keeping track of the monarch butterfly population and i saw that it kept on climbing up and the population started getting bigger and bigger.
14816176,0,1,0,think that the tempter dose not matter as long as the butter file can survive.
14816176,0,2,0,i think the claim is false because the number of butter flies has changed
14816180,10,1,1,"The sand temperature affects whether leatherback eggs hatch as male or female because looking at the data, males have lower temperatures while the females have more.\n"
14816180,10,2,1,"I think that the temperature in the sand in Raine Island, Australia has NOT been decreasing since 1960, because in our data, the temperature is actually increasing instead of decreasing, for example in 1960, the temperature was 84.5 F, and in 2016, the temperature is up to 85.5."
14816188,0,1,0,because if it is cold the babies will die
14816188,0,2,0,IDK
14816193,0,1,1,When the temperature is higher its seems to male it slower because all of the chrysalis is 59 degrees or above and all of the caterpillars are 60 degrees and under. The chrysalis stage comes first and is all a higher temp than the caterpillars stage is after the chrysalis stage and is a lowe temp.
14816193,0,2,1,In 1996 the count was 909.50 million and just a year after it dropped to 630.50 and all the way up in 2013 the count was 33.50 million so it has dropped about 880 million.
14816201,0,1,0,"The temperatures of a monarch butterfly's can affect the life cycle because for example, the intense heat may interfere with butterfly's natural habitat and life cycle changes and can put heat on monarch butterfly's life cycle by shutting down their organs, or maybe slowing down the process of growing."
14816201,0,2,1,"The monarch butterfly population has decreased by millions. The amount in 1996 909.50, to 2013 33.50. That was a HUGE decrease in population. I should have their job because I even know that."
14816202,10,1,1,why i bileve that tempicher effects weather they are male or female because if you look on the cart most male eggs have lower tepicer and female has higher tempicher that is my reason why
14816202,10,2,0,on the chart it shows that the temperature has decreased and in crested over time making this evidence true
14816204,0,1,0,i picked partly true and parly false because i feel like a butterfly starts asa catterpiller then grows to be a butterfly like other butterflys like ones we have in maine like the ones that come out in the summer and they have to have temperture thats not to hot or cold that is what i think\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\
14816204,0,2,0,i think it is true because it said people whached the butterfly so i think it is true if they said they whached the butterflyin mexico it has to be in the right temperture not to warm or to cold.\n
14816205,10,1,1,females only hatch above 85 degrees and males hatch at 85 degrees and lower
14816205,10,2,1,in the year 2016 the temperature was higher than in 1960
14816207,0,1,0,i think that the statement was true because a butterfly cant be in the cold for as long as a caterpillar can because of the high winds and over the rain or snow coming down with all the hard pressure.
14816207,0,2,1,i think this claim is partly true and false because monarch count has stayed in the millions but the numbers have gone way lower. since 1996
14816209,0,1,0,I think this claim is true because the butterfly can't be in the cold or high winds unlike a caterpillar that stays on the ground.
14816209,0,2,1,I think this claim is partly true and false because the monarch count has stayed in the millions but the numbers have increasingly have gone way lower sense 1996.
14816211,10,1,1,the leather back turtles gender is of the heat the females are mostly hotter than the males. the two that i pointed to were a boy and a girl the girls 5 hotter than the boy
14816211,10,2,1,when i sorter the years i  the new one is the hottest with 85.57 and the last is 84.56
14816239,10,1,0,I think the claim is false because there were similar tempters and it was out of order if it was male or female and in the wild scientists cant control the tempter of the beach so why wouldn't there be more of one type of gender
14816239,10,2,0,all the temperatures are reasonibly close to each other
14816267,10,1,0,i said no because it says on the top temperature 85.80 and its a female and on the 2nd one down is says 85.04 and its a male
14816267,10,2,0,no because it goes from 85.21 to 86.72 also it keeps going from 84 to 85.
14816271,10,1,1,I say yes because it seems that the male are in the low 80s and that the male also and the female are hatching as female in the high 80s
14816271,10,2,1,I say that it is false because the weather is staying at the mid 85-88 and that means it is only getting warmer not colder
18715104,0,1,1,when the caterpiler is in his chrysalis stage it is hoter but when it is in its normal stage it is ushiy less worm [NOTE: grayed out rows already coded in Feb13 file]
18715104,0,2,0,because eavry one of them are diffrent numbers\n
18715107,10,1,0,I really don't know.
18715107,10,2,0,I really don't know
18715116,0,1,0,Because the temperature is higher.
18715116,0,2,0,Because the numbres on the chart.
18715119,0,1,0,I think it's partly true and partly false because there are some caterpillars that have not became a chrysalis in the same temperature as the caterpillars that have already became chrysalis.
18715119,0,2,0,I think it's true because from 1994 to 2006 there has been about ten more or less than the year before and/or the year after that.
18715120,0,1,0,butterfly's like the warmness but it does not help them grow does the warmness help us grow we like it like butterfly's it does not help us grow.
18715120,0,2,0,because more butterfly's have grown sense 1993 so the population has grown and grown sense then
18715133,0,1,1,"the monarch is a caterpillar when it is bellow 59 degrees and its a chrysalis when it is 59 degrees or higher.  But not always, #3 was a caterpillar while it was 59.36 degrees and #29 was still a cater pillar when it was 60.90 degrees."
18715133,0,2,0,"In 1993, when scientists started keeping track, there where 311.50 million Monarchs, but in 2018 there were 302.50 million Monarchs."
18715142,10,1,0,yes because 50 50
18715142,10,2,0,because in the picture it was dawn and some time's its cold at night time
18715149,0,1,0,i think it is true because it said on one that it is a caterpillar and it was 56.84 (F) but then when it was in a chsalar so the wather sangis all the time so the caterpillar is in all cinds of wether.
18715149,0,2,0,because there are no data that the monarch butterfly has stayed in one place for many times in a row. it did not come back in 2013 but they did come back in 2014. so it is false they did not stay in on place for a whily\n
18715155,10,1,0,I think its true because in the important data its says the temperature can change if its a girl or boy
18715155,10,2,0,"I know why it would be true, because Where it says claim two,  it says that its decreasing."
18715159,10,1,0,?
18715159,10,2,0,?
18715176,10,1,0,it shows that the higher temperature always gets female and every low temperature would be male
18715176,10,2,0,in many years there's proof of temperature rising an decreasing back and forth.
18715180,0,1,0,Because you have to know the butterfly's temperature if you are going to learn about them\n
18715180,0,2,0,Because mexico can not stay the same it haves to change at some point that's what I think.
18715188,10,1,0,because when my uncle was in the coast gaured  had to practice scuba diving and when he did did they broat like a almost 100 year old turtle in i think i said i think to do somethng with it he never told me what he did with the turtle
18715188,10,2,0,because i was watching a lazar beam vid and he said tutles are mostly laying eggs in kindoff middil tempature  but i belive hed tell us if they were laying eggs in warm wether or cold wether
18715201,10,1,1,Because some male temps are low that means that females are high temps. But some males are quite high in temps.
18715201,10,2,0,The graph shows that the temps of the sand have decrease but in some years they got higher.
18715202,0,1,0,I think this is true because if it is super cold outside the butter fly will be very cold and might freeze to death.  But if it is to hot the butter fly might die of heat.
18715202,0,2,0,The answer to the question is false.  It is false because the information I am getting says that it has gone up a lot more.
18715205,0,1,1,because some are a high temperature and the monarchs are still caterpillars but some of the low temperatures are chrysalises
18715205,0,2,1,because the butterfly count goes down a lot ever 1 to 2 years
18715206,10,1,1,I think its true because if you look at the data on the chart you can see that male turtles are hatched when the sand temperature is 85.04 and below and the females temperature is  is 85.04 and higher.
18715206,10,2,1,"It has not decreased since 1960 it accutally risen a little bit. Because, if you look on the chart 1960 the temperature was 84.56 put then in about ten years it droped down a little bit but then rose back up, In 2002 the temperature was 86.72. It has risen 1.26 in the temperature."
18715211,0,1,0,I dont know
18715211,0,2,0,i dont know
18715214,10,1,1,"True, because if the sand is cool then it is a male, but if the sand is hot then it is a female."
18715214,10,2,0,"Yes, because if you look at the temperature it is going down and down more."
18715239,0,1,0,they wod be dead of the temprchor.\n
18715239,0,2,0,becase mecsco is a relhy wome stat. they wodnot be daed.
18715259,10,1,0,I think this claim is true because in Playa the temperature is 85.80 and the turtle is a Female and in Playa the temperature is 80.67 and the turtle is a Male.
18715259,10,2,0,I think this is false because in 1960 the temperature was 84.56 and the the temperature in 1962 was 85.10 so its been going up not down.
18715267,0,1,0,i dont know
18715267,0,2,0,I dont know\n
18715293,10,1,0,BECASE IM HOMEAFOBIC AND I HATE TRANSEGENDER
18715293,10,2,0,this is boring
18715322,10,1,1,The females are usually hotter.
18715322,10,2,0,It has not been decreasing because it got higher.
18715324,0,1,0,because some times its colder than other times and its still the same part of the cycle\n
18715324,0,2,1,because its going down evrey year
18715326,10,1,0,Most eggs don't hatch with warm weather but they also can hatch themselves.\n
18715326,10,2,0,The reason why I think it is false is because it can't be true.\n
18715337,0,1,0,"because it starts from caterpillar to chrysalis, then it ends with a caterpillar not a butterfly."
18715337,0,2,0,because it went from 33.50 to 909.50.
18715341,10,1,0,Because when it's a girl the temperature is in the 80's and when its a boy the temperature is in the 80's too.
18715341,10,2,0,Since 1960 the temperature has bean in the 80's but it has bean going down but not by much at all
18715352,0,1,0,i think  it is false because they don't rush right throw  there life sycel
18715352,0,2,0,because they go to mexico in winter
18715354,10,1,1,In Playa most of the females sand temperature is higher than the males sand temperature. Like number 1 Playa 85.80 was a female. then number 8 at Playa 80.67 was a male. So it must make a difference if the temperature of the sand is high or low because almost all of the lower ones are male and most of the higher ones are female.
18715354,10,2,1,In 1960 the sand temperature was 84.56 and in 2016 the sand temperature was 85.57. So clearly it has not been decreasing it has actually been increasing.
18715383,10,1,0,latherback sea turtles are the bigest species. and they can get up to 2000 pounds but the green sea turtle can get up to 500 pounds an live up to 100 years old
18715383,10,2,0,it is very important to know understand protect these beautiful  animals
18715391,0,1,0,i don't know you tell me
18715391,0,2,0,if anyting there over popualated
24465101,0,1,1,"All higher temperatures above 59.50 are in stage 3 or 4 because of how high the temperature is in there location. But just 6 of them are still in stage 2 though.I have thought about it and came up with this theory, they may have been born just went the temperature was warmer and they still are growing fast but just have not made the cut."
24465101,0,2,0,It is true because from 1993 to 2018 it has stayed very close .The count is off by 9.00 million monarch butterflies.
24465106,10,1,1,I can see that the Female has bigger numbers then the Males
24465106,10,2,0,I think its False because its not the first one to be the lowest number
24465107,0,1,0,becuse i feel like it is true and
24465107,0,2,0,becase\n
24465121,0,1,1,"The claim is false because I sorted it lowest to highest temperature and the caterpillars was yes, all in one group, but they kept going back 'n' forth. Caterpillars, chrysalis, then back to caterpillars. \nSo therefor the caterpillars will form into pupa at different rates in different temperature, however, it changes groups in the same temperature!\nFor instance, 59.36 is in the caterpillar bunch, but, the pupa is in 59.54.So maybe temperatures could support faster growth, however, due to the continuous changing i believe that this statement is also incorrect. That is why the statement is partly true, and partly false.\n"
24465121,0,2,0,"I think that this is incorrect information because it states ""...the monarch butterfly population in mexico has stayed about the same.""\nHowever, as you see in my graph, through the years the population has gone anywhere from a bit less than 100 million to 900 million!\nDue to they scattering of the population I believe that in the past recorded years the population hasn\'t decreased, or increased. It has went back and forth, meaning that it is not only healthy, but that it is going on a natural in predicable course.\nSo, in conclusion, claim #2 is completely incorrect."
24465153,10,1,0,I think it is true because a turtle needs to feel comfortable when they are laying their eggs.
24465153,10,2,1,In 1960 the temperature was 84.56 and the temperature kept getting higher not decreasing.\n
24465156,10,1,0,sometimes it might be harder to lay eggs and give birth in colder-weather because it might hurt
24465156,10,2,0,it might of been decreasing because of the weather
24465163,10,1,0,Cause the type of turtles only hatch as males
24465163,10,2,0,It goes down and goes up\n
24465171,0,1,0,I think it is because if its cold the butterfly might freeze and if they are warm they will have a longer lifespan and they migrate so if the to some place warm and the tempature changes they might die
24465171,0,2,0,I think the numbers change depending like how much food they\neat or the tempature or the breeding.
24465178,10,1,1,84.20 and up is allmost all female
24465178,10,2,1,if anything the temperature has bean going up in stead of down because if you look is gose from 84.56 all the way to 85.57\n
24465189,0,1,1,"Every chrysalis tested had a temperature between 59 degrees and 63 degrees. The majority of  the chrysalises were inside.\nEvery caterpillar tested was between 54 and 60 degrees. Most caterpillars were outside. the locations for both were very close between more inside or more outside. Overall, I think it is partially true is because it is true, but the difference in temperature ranges was very small and might not mean anything. Also, the location may or may not have made a difference."
24465189,0,2,1,The count overall got smaller.
24465201,0,1,1,if it is warm out it will change faster than if it is cold
24465201,0,2,0,it will stay the same because it is warm\n all year around
24465203,10,1,1,"The temperature for male eggs was between 80-86, which is lower than the 84-87 that the female eggs had. I believe that if the egg is warmer, females will hatch. If it's colder, males will hatch."
24465203,10,2,0,"The temperature seems to go up and down each year. It isn't exactly decreasing, but it does go down a tiny bit each year. But then it will rise again, being back to the temperature it was before. I believe it's partly true, but the temperature rises again in a few years,"
24465214,0,1,0,i'm not good with math\n
24465214,0,2,0,this is why i think that the answer is true because up in the right corner  it says that in mexico the population stayed about the same.
24465223,0,1,0,because if the temperature change  will efeck\nit and it will not think it is clam.
24465223,0,2,0,in mexioco the count of marnark buttr flys stay the same because it is always worm there\n
24465231,0,1,1,"For the first 2 data reports, both ""butterflies"" were outside. 2\'s butterfly was outside in warmer weather, and was a chrysalis already. 1\'s butterfly\'s was in a cooler weather than 2 so warmer weather does speed up the life cycle of a butterfly."
24465231,0,2,1,"As you can see in the data...over the years the butterfly population in Mexico has changed. There were way more butterflies in the 90's. in the 2000's the numbers died down , but in the early and late 2010's it slowly started rising again."
24465255,0,1,0,I think That It's Partly true And Partly False Because When You Look At the chart it Kinda Changes The form By tempature But it Kinda Doesn't.
24465255,0,2,1,Because when You Look At Them It starts at 909.50 and goes all the way down to 33.50. So It Dropped Very Low When through the years.
24465260,10,1,1,I think this is true because if you look at the temperatures \n84 degrees and up are all females and if you look at the male temperatures they are all 86 and under.
24465260,10,2,1,If you look at the years under the year 2000 they have all smaller temperatures than the sand in the 2000's. So that means that the temperature increased actually.
24465276,10,1,0,As you can see the claim is false one of the female leatherbacks are 82.45 and it was at suriname and a difrent leatherback was 86.97 and it was at suriname so it is false
24465276,10,2,0,as you see the years to 1960 to 2016 the 1960 is at 84.56\nbut the 2016 is at 85.57 so it is false\n
24465293,10,1,0,i think that because they can both be man or femal
24465293,10,2,0,because the heat goes upbut it also goes low\n
25416110,0,1,0,"The data shows the caterpillars are turning into chrysalis at certain temperatures without supplying anymore info. How much did they eat? What did they eat? Where did they live? When did they eat? Were they sick? There's a lot more that we would need to know in order to tell. There are indoor caterpillars that turned in to chrysalis, but outdoor caterpillars, too. For all we know, the outdoor ones could be more productive out in the wild, and the indoor ones may just be fed and lazy."
25416110,0,2,0,"In 2013, the population was 33.50 million, but in 1998, it was almost 30 times that! Not much more to say."
25416116,0,1,0,"I think its partly true and partly false Because, it depends where they are like if there  Africa i could be jest right or too hot or in Maine it could be to cold that's why they go away for the winter. They go the warmer climits when there climit is too cold. That's why I think its partly true and partly false."
25416116,0,2,1,"I think false because, They been going down in the last few years. Also when it gose down also the year is too so this shows something to do with us! Thats why I think its False."
25416119,0,1,0,The reason why is because heat can change how will it gose thought it's cycle because it can shevle up and it could die in the cold due to the tempture drop.
25416119,0,2,0,i think that it is parlty true and partly false. i think this because even though it is about the same  dosen't mean that it did not drop before.
25416120,0,1,0,the temperature does not seem to affect the butterfly's life cycle.
25416120,0,2,1,its not the same. the population has jumped around but has gotten smaller. it slowly gets smaller.
25416124,10,1,1,I think it is true because in the data the lower temperature the more males and the higher temperature the more females.
25416124,10,2,0,it has been decreasing but not very fast.
25416144,0,1,1,"If you look at the temperatures from lowest to highest, you see that all the lowest temperatures say caterpillar and the higher temperatures say chrysalis. This shows that the temperature of the habitat affects how quickly monarch butterfly's life cycle stages change."
25416144,0,2,0,"In my graph, the dots representing the number of butterflies are scattered all over the place, definitely not the same. This proves that the claim is false."
25416146,10,1,0,I don't think that the temperature affects there gender because they were already made in the costumier of the turtle. So if I was in my moms costumier and it was hot I don't think that would affect my gender. But this is a hole different animal. But its not able to switch its gender.\nA mom cant just say i want a girl. that's not possible.
25416146,10,2,1,there has been forest fires in Australia. its been alot hotter there since before the fire
25416147,10,1,1,"Most of the male eggs are hatched in cooler weather, however most of the female eggs are in a little bit warmer weather"
25416147,10,2,0,The weather is not going down. I know that because in 2002 it was just about the same tempature as it was in 2012.
25416149,0,1,0,i think it is true because if there cocoon is frozen then they can't be changing and there stages of becoming a butterfly.That's why i think the temperature matters in a butterfly's habitat.
25416149,0,2,1,i think it's false because it says they started tracking in 1993 and from 1993 to 2013 the population has gone down instead of staying the same it went from 909 million to 33 million.This is why i think that the monarch butterfly's population didn't stay the same.
25416155,10,1,0,it does not madder about the weather. It just madders what the turtle gave birth to in the eggs.
25416155,10,2,0,It could be because of rain and the temp in the air around the sand that makes the sand colder. its defiantly going down.
25416156,10,1,1,Lots of the turtles that were raised in a cooler environment were males. A piece of evidence is from 80.60 to 83.85 are all males. The females are manly in the group with higher temperature. For example from 85.42 to 88.08 are all females.
25416156,10,2,1,I think the claim is false because in 1960 the temperature was 84.66 on Raine island. Over 58 years it has increased and decreased but in 2018 it has gone up to 85.67.
25416180,0,1,0,Becuase if its cold the monarch will die becuse it does not have much fat on it so if will freeze to death
25416180,0,2,0,Because more and more butterflies come there each year.
25416186,10,1,0,"if you look at 1,2,and 3 the first is female and the temperature is at 85.80 and then the second one is male the temperature for that one is 85.04 but if you look at the third its female but the temperature is 84.77 which is colder than the males"
25416186,10,2,0,if you look at sample 6 in 1962 the temperature is at 85.10 but then if you look at sample 27 in 2014 its at 88.18
25416201,10,1,1,"I think it is partly true and partly false because most of the sand that was 85 or higher were females, and most of the sand that 85 or lower were males. It isn't like this through the whole thing."
25416201,10,2,1,"I think this claim is false because if you look at the evidence you see that it has barely going up, and it has stayed in the 80's for most of the years."
25416204,10,1,0,because the male turtles have to stay safe and if we are being honest i don't remember the question
25416204,10,2,0,This is hipping because of the forest fires and polotchipon\nthat has been happening for years
25416205,0,1,0,"sometimes it did turn into a chrysalis, and sometimes it didn't. Iv'e heard that it depends how much food it has."
25416205,0,2,0,The number (in millions) goes up every year. that is NOT staying at around the same number.
25416207,10,1,1,"If your looking at the chart, the females temperature is much higher than the males but, some of the temperatures are the same for both the genders. Thats why I think its partly true."
25416207,10,2,0,"If your looking at the chart, all the temperatures are around 83,85, and 84. Which means they haven't been decreasing at all."
25416211,0,1,1,"when it was cold outside they were mostly still caterpillars. I also saw that some of them were inside witch I think has effected how they grew to be butterflies because it was warmer inside then outside some days,  I think that may of effected how they grew."
25416211,0,2,0,When the years went by the monarch butter flies population goes up little by little. so that means the population did not stay the same.
25416214,10,1,1,"When you sort the data from low to high,you can clearly see that the claim is partly true. On the lower side of the chart, it is only male but in the middle some of the temps. Run up to 85.19 dagress. Which was uncommen for the sex. Wich is why only part of the claim is true."
25416214,10,2,1,"In the data if we take the oldest date and the newest date, we will see that the water is accutaully is incressing."
25416231,0,1,1,because when in the higher temperatures the insect is mostly in the caterpillar stage and when it's in the lower temp they're mostly in the chrysalis stage but in some parts of the table that is not true.
25416231,0,2,1,every year since 1996 the monarch butterfly population has gone down every time a new year comes so the butterfly population cannot be the same if in 1996 909.50 million butterflies and the in 2013 there are only 33.50 million they have gone down by about 878 million
25416288,10,1,0,Sea turtles are kinda the same as people. When they are born the heat doesn't change the gender. For ex: Sample number 3 and 16 They both have 84 as there temperature but one is female and one is male. It depends on if the father gave that egg the X or Y in the chromosomes.
25416288,10,2,1,In 1962 the temperature was at 85.10 degrees. and you keep going up in years the temperature goes up and down depending on the weather. In 2008 the temperature was at 85.21. That is a increase if anything in the temperature. it was a 0.11 increase in heat.
25416293,10,1,0,I think this is false because they are all different temperatures and one of the males temperature is 84.98 and a females is 84.20 so those are almost the same temperature so it does not matter.
25416293,10,2,0,I think it is not changing because they are all different and all over the place with the temperature\n
25416310,0,1,1,The temperature of the monarch butterfly's habitat can kind of affect how fast they change if the conditions are to hot they might form faster than if the conditions were cooler. the butterfly's can sometimes be in the sand and if they are lower in the sand they wont get as hot but  the higher up they are in the sand the hotter they will get and might form faster. if they are i sand they can change all kinds of speeds but it can all depends on where they are in the sand.
25416310,0,2,1,The scientists are saying that the butterfly's population is staying the same but from 1996 to 2013 they have lost loads of butterfly's and the scientists are saying that the butterfly's population in Mexico is staying about the same.
25416312,10,1,1,I said what I said because of males where more cornily born in colder places
25416312,10,2,0,because of their ar fewer turtles
25416318,0,1,0,"because if its to cold it might freeze, killing the butterfly, and if its to warm or hot it could die of exhaustion or it could over-heat causing the stages of a butterfly to slow down."
25416318,0,2,0,because over the years the count of butterfly's in mexico had increased and decreased alot
25416320,0,1,0,I think its false because if stage 3 froze than i will take more time to unfreeze.
25416320,0,2,0,I think is true its because the monarch butterflies like it warn in Mexico.
25416321,10,1,0,The temperature of the sand shouldn't affect the eggs because when you look at your data table you can see there is no clear pattern for the temperatures to prove that there is a way for the temperature to affect whether leatherback eggs are hatch as male or female.
25416321,10,2,0,I think this is true because the data table shows that the temperature was decreasing lower and lower each time they tested it.
25416324,10,1,1,higher the tempeature the more females hatched
25416324,10,2,0,the temperature is always within 2 degrees\n
25416330,10,1,0,i think its true because the temperature affects whether leatherback eggs hack then they will die
25416330,10,2,0,i think true because in australia they have rain and sun some times and i think that would affect them in australia
25416336,10,1,0,"I think it is false because the turtle born in Playa for example is a female that was born at a temperature of 85.80 degrees Fahrenheit and one of the males born in Playa is 84.98. There is also males, and females born in Suriname that are almost exactly the same temperature when they were born. In conclusion that is why i think that The sand temperature doesn't affect whether leatherback eggs hatch as a male or female.   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\np"
25416336,10,2,0,I don't think the temperature of the sand in Raine Island has been decreasing because in the data it shows that the sand temperature from 1960 all the way up to 2012 has been in a five degree radious from eachother.
25416344,0,1,0,I think it is true because if it is cold it is harder for them to turn into a butterfly because it is so cold outside. Another example is if it is really hot outside then it would be hard for the crystal to change because it is so hot.
25416344,0,2,0,I think that it is true because they say every winter they migrate Mexico and they estimate the butterfly population every year sense 1993.
25416347,10,1,1,all the females are at a higher tem like 85 butt the males are lower like 80 but some males are at 85 too and some females are as low as 84
25416347,10,2,0,they went up 1 or 2 but some went down 1
25416352,10,1,0,a male was born i 86.54 temp
25416352,10,2,1,the temp is incresing
25416355,10,1,0,The thing I just read said that the eggs can change but nothing about weather effects the turtle eggs.
25416355,10,2,0,The report dos not say it decreases.
25416363,0,1,0,"I think this is true because the tempertature can effect how the butterfly can grow, also how fast it grows."
25416363,0,2,0,I think it is partly true because butterflys can stay the same but not that long. I also know that mexico has alot of butterflys.
25416386,10,1,0,because some eggs need to be incubated and stuff and some dot so maybe the sand can cause it to not you hatch it can take longer
25416386,10,2,0,because some places sand and stuff can be a different but idk if has been changeing
25416389,0,1,0,Because it takes time for it to go through the stages. The temperature could change it maybe a little bit but not a lot for it to change how quick the stages go by.
25416389,0,2,0,Because as the data shows from 1996 to 2013 the number of butterfly has gone down a big number. So what clam two is saying is that the numbers has stay the same but looking at the data you can see that is not true.
25976100,0,1,0,Different butterflies are at different stages and the temperature  has nothing to do with how fast the butterfly goes through the stages of its life.
25976100,0,2,0,The count of butterflies in mexico go down and up alot. This is due to the evidence on the chart. But mexico seems to have more butterflies in the late 90's. But in the closer years (like 2017 and 2016) they have a fair amount of monarch butterflies.
25976103,10,1,0,I think its only Party True / Partly False. I think this because if you look at the data you will see mainly in one locations its true about the claim but once you look at both you see that it's its not all true. Because for example #28 and #2 Work then if you look at another pair such as #22 and #26 it doesn't work in the slightest if you compare with the first example.
25976103,10,2,0,I think this is Partly True/Partly False because if you look at 1960 #24 the temperature is 84.56 F. Then in 1968 it decreases #14 to 83.75 F. So far its true but then in 1988 #5 it increases to 85.59 F and it really just keeps this process going over and over.
25976110,10,1,0,if the sand is hot it will eafeck the eggs
25976110,10,2,0,if it did rain since 1960 the sand will be wet
25976116,10,1,0,Claim: My claim is that the tempeture of the sea turtles eggs doesnt affect the gender. \nEvidence: In the data it doesn't neccarsily show weather or not the it makes a different of the gender on the types of sea turtles. For example the lowest tempeture. The highest temperture is 88.8 which is a female. The lowest temperture is 80.60 which is a male. Also in the data all the tempertures are mixed around it doesnt show anything like females are always hotter and males are colder and vice versa.\nReasoning: That is the reasoning why i do not think that the tempeture of the egg in the sand does not impact the gender of the sea turtle.
25976116,10,2,1,"I do not think it has been decreasing because the graph shows otherwise. The data shows the sand going higher from year to year. In 1960 the temporture of the sand was 84.56, and in 2016 (most resent year on graph) the sand was 85.57. So it was not decreasing at all it was actually increasing."
25976119,10,1,1,The temperature was higher for females.
25976119,10,2,1,The temperature was going up.
25976124,0,1,0,I think it is true because if this butterfly went some where really cold then i think it would affect how quickly it goes through their stages.
25976124,0,2,0,"I think it is kinda true that the population has stayed the same because in the summer i haven't seen alot of them but, their could be alot and i just don't see them so i think it is kinda true and kinda not true."
25976146,0,1,0,it goes up and down in the data.
25976146,0,2,0,you need to start at 1993 and count up till 2018
25976149,10,1,0,I think its partly true and partly false because some of the male and females have almost the same exact temperature and some of them have lower or higher temperatures so it can be either gender depending on the coldness or the warmth of the sand or the eggs.
25976149,10,2,0,I think its partly true because some of the years the temperature is colder than the other years 2002 is warmer then 2008 and 2010 because they are colder then the later years.
25976156,0,1,1,"My claim is that the temperature that a chrysalis is in depends on how fast it grows into an adult because, if the temperature is 50 that is not normal for a butterfly to grow in the average temperature is around 60 degrees Fahrenheit. So if it was 50 degrees it would be below what they are used to so it would grow slower."
25976156,0,2,1,"The highest count of butterfly was in 1996 and ever since then it has dropped rapidly over the past 17 years. And it has dropped by over 800 million, so it has not been staying the same."
25976160,10,1,1,i think is is true because the lowest for males to spawn is 80.60 temp and the lowest for females is 84.20 temp so the hotter the sand it will be a female the colder the sand is it going to be a male and that's why the sand temperature affects if it's a male or female
25976160,10,2,0,i think it is partly true and partly false because the temperature is dropping down and rising back up from the 1960 to the 2016
25976180,10,1,1,I think the sand temperature does affect whether the turtle is male or female according to the data chart any temperature under 85 degrees the egg hatches and it's a male any temperature above 85 when the egg hatches it's a female.
25976180,10,2,0,The temperatures have not been decreasing they have been staying around 85 degrees the coldest its been there is 84 degrees.
25976186,0,1,0,it is the same speed going throthe life sicel.
25976186,0,2,0,the tempocher stead the same
25976201,0,1,1,I think this claim is partly true because most of the the ones in the 60's are chrysalises and most of the 50's are not
25976201,0,2,0,i think this claim is false because This table jumps from 556.00 million to 109.50 million
25976204,0,1,1,"I think that it is partially true because it shows that the warmer the temperature the faster it will grow but, I believe this only goes for when the caterpillar is outside because it seems that when a caterpillar is inside it doesn't grow as quickly because  it's not in it's natural habitat."
25976204,0,2,0,I think that this is false because they say the population stays the same but it doesn't. The population is more scattered than same.
25976205,10,1,0,because there all in the 80 to 85 temperature so it cant be because of the temperature. Some of them are almost the same temperatures but there different genders.\n
25976205,10,2,0,because in 1960 the sand temperature was 84.56 and in and in 1972 it was 84.20
25976206,0,1,1,"I think this claim is true because when the monarch butterfly was outside and the temperature was at 56.84 it was only a caterpillar. But when a different monarch butterfly was also outside at a temperature of 59.54, it was already  in a chrysalis."
25976206,0,2,0,"I think this claim is wrong because in 1993 the population of monarch butterflies were at 311.50 million. But by 2003, the population has risen to 556.00 million. And by 2018 it went back down to 302.50. This is why I think the claim is false."
25976207,0,1,0,I think that  it is partly Fales cuz it lakes a long time to              \nbecome a butterfly..
25976207,0,2,0,They when to know how the lefe sikole goses so they keep track of the butterflys.
25976211,10,1,1,"When the sand temperature is hotter the eggs hatch as female, and when the sand is cooler the eggs hatch as male. For example, some of the male egg temperature were, 80.60, 82.45, and 83.25. But then some of the female temperatures were, 87.09, 88.08 and 86.54, so there is a big difference in those temperatures which means that the eggs hatch as female when the sand is hotter, and the eggs hatch as male when the sand is cooler."
25976211,10,2,0,The temperatures
25976214,0,1,0,"I think that the tempature can affect how fast the butterfly goes through it's life cycles because you don't want the temperature to be too hot or too cold, so I think that the outside was perfect tempature because if it was too hot the butterfly would probably not be able to grow as fast but you would want kind of hot so a little hotter then warm. You don't really want it to be that cold for a butterfly because then it won't grow fast you barely want any cold."
25976214,0,2,0,I think that the population has gone up by so much it has gone up by like 800 million
25976239,10,1,0,because the numbers jump all over the place from high to low.So it seems like it dosent matter what tempature it is
25976239,10,2,0,It is false because in 2002 it was 86.72 and in 2008 it was 15.21 but in 1964 it was 84.56\n
25976242,10,1,1,We believe the temperature of the sand does contribute to male or female eggs.  Male's were primarily hatched in the low 80's to 83 range.  Females were primarily hatched in the 85 - 88 range.
25976242,10,2,1,We believe this is false because since 1960 the temperatures have risen.
25976259,0,1,0,"The claim is false because one Monarch it grew up at 59.54 degrees, and it is in the 3rd stage of growing which is the chrysalis. While a Monarch who grew up in warmer temps at 63.14 degrees is at the same step in there life cycle the chrysalis. And that is why this claim is false"
25976259,0,2,1,The claim is false because in 1996 their where 909.5 million butterfly's in Mexico. But in 2008 the butterfly population has gone down to 253 million and it decreased from there. Until 2013 where there was only 33.5 million butterfly's in Mexico so it is pretty obvious that the claim is false because the butterfly population went down 876 million in 17 years.
25976271,10,1,1,The reason why is because the 8th sample was at Playa it was 80.67 degrees and it was a male and the 9th sample it was at the same place and the temperature was 84.20 and it was a female. So the warmer it is it is a female the colder it is it is a male. Every temperature that is over 84 degrees is a female every temperature that is under 84 degrees is a male.\n
25976271,10,2,0,Out of time
25976273,0,1,1,"I think true because if a monarch butterfly's habitat is cold then it  will not be able to transfer throw out all of the other stages in its life cycle, but if a monarch butterfly's habitat is warm then it will be able to transfer throw the stages. Just like if a human goes out side in the cold then the fluids inside of your body will not stay warm, but if you are inside and it is warm inside then the fluids in your body will keep running faster throw out your body."
25976273,0,2,0,the
25976274,10,1,1,"I believe that the female are born in the higher temperature than the males. The numbers on the board for females the highest is 87.09 for for the temp, but for the boys it's like 83.62 for the temp."
25976274,10,2,1,"in 1960 the temperature was 84.56, but in 2016 the temperature is 85.57. it is going just a little higher"
25976281,10,1,0,I think its false because male and female turtles were being born in 85 degrees.The same goes for 84 degrees.
25976281,10,2,0,i think this claim is false because in the 1962 the temperature was 85.10 degrees and in 2012 was 85.06. the temperature has only dropped 0.6 degrees in 52 years.
25976288,0,1,0,hi my name is ................
25976288,0,2,0,frghn
25976298,0,1,1,all of the chrysalis are 60 or above and all of the caterpillar are below 59
25976298,0,2,0,because in 1996 there was 909 and a half million and in 2013 there is only 33 and a half million
38986101,0,1,0,because It's mostly the same temperature.
38986101,0,2,0,The count in millions has changed a lot\n
38986102,10,1,0,because sea turtles are dieing we got to say those sea turtles
38986102,10,2,0,because if sea turtles don't have enough sand they can't burrie there eggs and if they do predators will get to them.
38986104,10,1,0,I believe that the sand temperature affects whether the leather back eggs hatch as a fem. or male.Because in the article it said that scientist sometimes collect the eggs and control the temp. and then check if they are a fem. or male.
38986104,10,2,0,I believe that the claim is false because on the chart in 1960 the temp.was 84.56 and the other years have had a lower temp.And other years the temp. has been higher.
38986111,10,1,1,"Yes this is true because I sorted the temps from low to high, and on average the lower temps were all male hatchlings. and the high temps were all female, so yes there is a corallation between sand temperature and the the gender of the eggs of leatherback turtles."
38986111,10,2,0,"because this is dumb and I don't want to do it, and so Im not going to try. and also the temperatur is literally changed by 1 degree !!!!!!!!"
38986112,0,1,0,"i don""t know"
38986112,0,2,0,the highest population was in 2006
38986112,10,1,0,i choose no because all sands are the same
38986112,10,2,0,the chart shows that its decreasing
38986114,0,1,0,because it will still be in the 50 or 60 degrees if it is outside or inide
38986114,0,2,0,It increses every year\n
38986123,0,1,0,It's True because it is the same thing but their are a little diference. They almost have the same patterns.
38986123,0,2,0,Yes it has because it's been at a constant migration of the protest of the change of the butterfly started at 2020 to 1996.
38986155,0,1,0,its false because we don't have enough information.
38986155,0,2,0,true because everything ranges from 0 to 900
38986174,10,1,0,No because there are all diffrent types of temetures and they are both female and male so this claim is false. They all are 80 degres or over.
38986174,10,2,0,Because the tempature has been gouing up and down since 1960-2016.
38986188,0,1,1,The lower temperature they are in the caterpillar stage and in the higher temperature they are in a chrysalis stage.
38986188,0,2,0,its false because the count is going higher over the years.
55126115,10,1,0,dot no\n
55126115,10,2,0,you got to save the tretel\n
55126122,10,1,0,I don't think it really matters were they are born or what temp it is they will be any gender really think suriname has more boys than girl and playa has more girls than boys.
55126122,10,2,0,well some years it was decressing and some years it was getting hotter so i dont know if thats a true fact that ever sence 1960 the sand temp has been decreasing
55126134,10,1,0,I think the terteles are lether back becuse there are diferet to other  tipes of anamules
55126134,10,2,0,Becuse I think that sand can not be wash away from the bech the humens
55126135,10,1,0,The sand temperature does not hove anything to do with if the leatherback being male or female.\n\n
55126135,10,2,0,I think this claim is true because if the temp changes out side the sand changes.
55126138,0,1,0,it taks abowt a yere
55126138,0,2,0,they leev for winter
55126152,10,1,1,well most females in the data are born in 85.50 degrees  or more and most males are born below 85.50 degrees. all but 2 females are bore in less 80.50 degrees. and there not 1 male is born in more that 80.50. so its not exactly true but it is party true
55126152,10,2,0,"it is false because i 1960 it was 84.56 degrees, and in 1962 it was 85.10 degrees, so it is not decreasing."
55126154,0,1,0,if its to cold it will freeze to death and if its to warm its perfect temp for it to live
55126154,0,2,0,So they don't over populate and have too much
55126165,0,1,1,Normaly when the temp is in the 60's they usually are in their chrysalis period of transformation. But one of the chrysalis periods is in the 50 to 59 degree range.
55126165,0,2,0,They have not stayed the same since scientists started keeping track. They actually have decreased by over 300 million the first year and then over 20 million the last year
55126172,10,1,1,there are more female in the higher temp and the males are in the lower temp and they kind of mix in the middle
55126172,10,2,1,the temp has been rising instead of going down
55126183,0,1,1,when the temperature is lower most of the butterflys are still caterpillers and when the temperature is higher most of the butterflys are chrysalis
55126183,0,2,0,this claim is false because in 1993 the count is about 311 million and in 2011 the count is about 144 million and that's a pretty big difference.
55276102,0,1,0,I think this is true because if you read 20 you can see why I think it is the right answer.
55276102,0,2,0,I have made a chart so you can see that I am right because they esmated.
55276116,10,1,0,"Sample 1 & Sample 2 were about the same temp but were Male and Female.\n\nBut in Sample 23 & 24 the temp was 4 degress different,but were also Male and Female."
55276116,10,2,0,The temp goes up by a degre and then one year it will go down by a degre.
55276119,0,1,1,i think it is  true because in this story it said it was faster when it was warm and not when it was cold\n
55276119,0,2,0,I think it is partly true partly false because some butter flys were made from the cacoon and sme had to die off so i dont know if it is true or false.\n
55276120,10,1,1,i think its partly true and partly false because number 1 and  2 are both 85 degrees and one is male and ones female but numbers 19 and 20 is a big different 19 is 80 degrees and its a male and 20 is 86 degrees and a female
55276120,10,2,0,I think this is false because number 27 is 2014 and 86 degrees and then we look at 1990 its also 86 degrees and then in 2016 its 85 degrees
55276133,10,1,0,If you look at the data you will see the data I highlighted their is a Temperature the same and they are Male and Female.
55276133,10,2,1,In 1960 Temperature was 84.56 and in 2016 the Temperature was 85.57 so it increased.
55276142,10,1,0,It's not about the sand tempature it's about if their genes are stronger and their genes dertermine what gender they are.
55276142,10,2,0,I think this is true because global warming could change the tempature of the sand.\n
55276155,0,1,1,If a monarch butter was in a cold tempertured area it would take longer because its to cold but if it was really warm the proces would go quicker.
55276155,0,2,0,The data shows that in 1996 the population of the Monarch butterfly was 909.50 and in 2013 the population is 33.50 which shows a gigantic difference through 1996-2013.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n
55276159,0,1,0,"It's false because if you look at the data, there are still some caterpillars that have the same temperature as the ones in the chrysalis's. That means they are in the same temperature as the ones who are growing up faster."
55276159,0,2,1,It hasn't stayed about the same because if you look at the amount of butterflies in 1996 is higher and the number just keeps going down and down over the years.
75336100,0,1,0,the go thro stoages and the wintr thay are thry millen miols from thay nachrol habtat
75336100,0,2,0,they cep track of the butrflis and the polplashen it just fin and the botrflis are fin thay do what the wont when ever thay wont .
75336101,0,1,0,I think when the caterpillar is outside it will get very warm and when the caterpillar is inside it will cool off.
75336101,0,2,0,The monarch butterfly stays in mexico because it likes the heat.\n
75336102,10,1,0,I think it is true because if it hurting the eggs then it will start to hurt the baby turtel inside and that means there might not be anymore turtels after this!
75336102,10,2,1,I think it is not true because it side it was decreasing when it has been going up for the most part it only goes down a littal bit!
75336103,10,1,0,there wore more boys than girls but  they were pretty close the same amount so that's why I said it was partly true and partly false
75336103,10,2,0,in 2016 it was only 85.57 and that isn't too far from 1962 and that was only 85.10 there is only 47-degree difference
75336104,0,1,0,because the butterfly has to go places
75336104,0,2,0,when they keep tract of them they can see were they are Going
75336106,0,1,1,"As I quickly looked through the location, and went onto temperature where I looked and saw that mainly the monarch butterfly does turn into the chrysalis quicker at hotter temperatures whether inside or outside."
75336106,0,2,1,"Because the monarch butterfly in mexico close to this year is dropping, dropping, and rising, it's never stayed in one place like the tens without bumping up a bit."
75336107,0,1,1,The caterpillars all went into their pupas when the temperature was 59 degrees (F) or higher.
75336107,0,2,0,"when you look at the graph, you can see it stayed about the same, other than a sudden spike in 1995 and 1996."
75336109,0,1,1,when the temature became hotter and more dense the buterfly started going through the cycles of their transformation
75336109,0,2,0,throughout most of the early 2000 the count of buterflies stayed realitivly the same only changing slightly fro 200 million to 500 million
75336112,0,1,0,because the report showd that the tempiture dosent realy matter
75336112,0,2,0,it canged a lot and they were in all kinds of places
75336114,0,1,0,because the tempature is the same all the time or in the same range or temp.
75336114,0,2,0,it is false because every year it is going up and up (the number in butterflys are increasing).
75336118,10,1,0,"because  the sand in the summer id most of the time on the top of the sand is hot but on the bottom, it is cool not super cold then  \n   \n? do they lay eggs in the winter"
75336118,10,2,0,the temp of the sand doesn't change
75336120,10,1,1,After studying the data I conclude that the sea turtles who were born when the sand temperatures were 84 degrees primarily turned out as females. But when the temperatures were 83.99 degrees and below the sea turtle were males.
75336120,10,2,0,Yes tbe temperature slowly decended from 86 degrees to 85 then to 84 then back up to 85. So in conclusion the temperature did go down by about a degree.
75336121,0,1,0,Because it shows inside and outside and two are both caterpillars but then also one is a chrysalis. That is the same tempachure so kinda true kinda false
75336121,0,2,1,It has decreased over the years in 1996 it was 909.50 and in 2013 it was 33.50. It has decreased a lot over the years so that statement is false. it almost went down 890.50
75336123,10,1,0,It is false because it never said anything about the temperature.  And it didn't say anything really about the male and female.
75336123,10,1,0,it's partly true and partly false because maybe the sand temperature does affect whether leatherback eggs to hatch as male or female but it could be false because it depends on the gender who knows if the sand temperature affects the animal's gender
75336123,10,2,0,I think its partly true and partly false because it could have changed it could have not changed
75336123,10,2,0,"It said ""The temperature of the sand in Raine Island, Australia had been decreasing since 1960"" In the sentence"
75336130,0,1,1,when outside it  chrysalis's faster and it's warmer outside
75336130,0,2,0,it went from 33.50 to 909.50
75336131,10,1,1,"Some males where  born in hot tempture same as females. It goes back and forth to say the heat affects the gender, if you say that  the hotter sand has females you would probly wrong  next time some males where born in high tempture  thats why its probly false."
75336131,10,2,1,from different years it goes up and down but It seems that Its increasing than decreasing. In 2002 and up its going up in heat that getting colder in those years so I presonly don't  think its decreasing I think its increasing.
75336142,10,1,0,because all female turtles lay their eggs on the beach and then she leaves them
75336142,10,2,0,because it says that on the recording page and every year it gets lower
75336144,10,1,0,because for some reason the heat makes the gender different and the turtles know this so they place their eggs in different places accordingly.
75336144,10,2,0,if you see the evidence you see that the first 2002 thing is 86.72 degrees but in the 2012 one it is 85.06
75336146,0,1,1,wel the data proves the fact true in the evidence because the higher temp the life cycle proceeded quicker
75336146,0,2,1,if you look at the chart you can see that over the years the population has slightly but steadily dropped like in 2013 there was 33.50 million monarchs but in 2014 there was 56.0.
75336147,0,1,0,In the chart to the right in the outside with the crysalis is almost the exact same outiside with a catipillar
75336147,0,2,0,If it stayed about the same it would have been in the 30s but now it went from thirty three to 56.50 within a year.
75336150,0,1,0,if the caterpillar is in the cold weather wean it is in a chrysalis it would slow it down the save its energy.
75336150,0,2,1,the butterfly population has gone down in 1996 it was at 909.50 in. 2013 it is at 33.50.
75336155,0,1,1,as the temprature ranged from 57-62 the catarrpillars turned into stage 3 crysiless depending on the location this could be caused by humidity outside or inside but as it got warmer they changed mostly on the warmer side inside and a little cooler outside again probably from humidity
75336155,0,2,1,as the years go by they get lesser and lesser from 909 million to 33 million
75336156,0,1,0,It was warm and it grew and it was cold and it grew the same time.
75336156,0,2,0,in 2013 there were 33.50 million and in 1996 there was 909.50 million and that is an 876 million difference.
75336167,10,1,1,because most of the time there are male and female sometimes there are just female and sometimes the a just males because male need to be colder to the ground or the won't be a male they will then be a female. female need to be warmer than the males if there to cold they will most likely to be a male
75336167,10,2,0,"because all the year I saw were all different yes. but, one of the things it showed that in 2002 86.72 for the heat in ('F). it shows that in 1994 in was 85.57  for the heat in ('F."
75336170,10,1,0,i think its false because it said that they hatch in the sand and go find safety in the sea they don't  say anything about having a special temature.
75336170,10,2,0,i think its true because it said in the subtitle that this was true.
75336173,0,1,1,because at temperatures higher than 60 the caterpiller would be in a chrysalis and any lower it was still a caterpiller.
75336173,0,2,1,"the butterfly population has dropped at increasing speeds instead of staying the same, the evidence is in 1996 the butterfly population was 909.50 million and in 2013 it is at 33.50 million."
75336174,10,1,0,it keeps the eggs warm\n
75336174,10,2,0,because ofclimat change
75336180,10,1,0,maybe it is because of  partly true/ partly False
75336180,10,2,1,yes because of its tempura is raising.
75336181,10,1,1,sometimes the female leatherbacks are born around 84 degrees to 87 degrees.\n
75336181,10,2,1,The temupature since 1860 has been going up until 2000s and started to go down and up.
75336182,0,1,0,I think it is not eftine becaues it do not say that it is
75336182,0,2,0,becaues it not chaging\n
75336186,0,1,0,"Usually, a caterpillar needs its time to hatch into a butterfly. That's why\nthey try to find the best place in a warm and slightly cold place like California and Mexico. If you don't know. On Day 11 the Chrysalis did not hatch faster or slower. It usually stays outside more than inside"
75336186,0,2,1,"When you look at the chart pay attention to the numbers of the population. It was going downward! In 1993 the population was 3 million to 1996, 9 million now look at 2013, 33 million! It was in the hundred million not 10 million! You can not say it has stayed the same when it fell down to 10 million. I think the claim is False!"
75336188,0,1,0,"I think it is true because different habitats can have an effect on stuff like the food there. not the right food can affect its life stages life, for example, it could be late on becoming a butterfly or like it could be a caterpillar for longer than it should"
75336188,0,2,0,because each year more go to Mexico because it's warm in Mexico.
75336189,10,1,0,"It says the sand temperature affects whether leatherback eggs hatch as male or female, but scientists figure out when they hatched."
75336189,10,2,0,"At 1998 first to number is getting lower just like what the claim #2 have say about that Raine Island, Australia, has been decreasing since 1960. but then the rest is the increasing then decreasing. I might actually not really know what their meanings are."
75336190,10,1,0,because it said it in the reading
75336190,10,2,0,because it was in the reading!!!!!
75336191,0,1,1,I think its partly true/ partly false because in some parts it's colder than the warm temperature and it still said chrysalis.
75336191,0,2,0,I think this because some years there very little and some years there was a lot.
75336197,0,1,0,I think that the temperature efaces the cycle cus of the  temp difference of the caterpillar and the chrysalis
75336197,0,2,0,jlb
75925101,0,1,0,"All of the facts that were included in this text had great details. I think temperature does effect how fast the monarchs go through their life cycle. I think this because if they get to cold when they are in their chrysalis they can freeze on the inside and not grow. Also, if it is too hot for the caterpillar in it's chrysalis it would probably kill them and cause them to not grow anymore."
75925101,0,2,0,I think this claim is partly true because mostly a lot of females make it to Mexico to lay eggs when they hatch the females die. That wouldn't make the population of butterflies be exactly the same. The females lay several eggs witch would make more not the same. It is almost rare for butterflies to make it back from Mexico because of the weather or they die in Mexico.
75925101,11,1,0,Partly false because I assorted the data table by temperature and some temperatures were the same but they had a different gender. Partly true because from 80-84 they were mostly only male turtles and just a few female turtles. Through 85-88 there was only female turtles.
75925101,11,2,0,I think false because I assorted the data table by lowest to highest year and from 1960-2016 the range in temperature stayed within  83-86 it could not be decreasing.
75925102,1,1,1,After 11 days there were more chrysalises when it was warmer and more caterpillars as it got colder. So warmer temps make the monarch butterfly's life cycle go faster.
75925102,1,2,1,The dots on my graph  are all over the place. It goes by the year and count by millions. Some dots are near the bottom and some are near the top. In my chart the numbers range from 33.50 million to 909.50.
75925102,10,1,1,I think the sand temperature affects whether leatherback eggs hatch as a male or a female. I think that because on the data the warmest sand had mostly females and the cooler the sand got the more males there was. The warmest sand a male was hatched in was 85.19. The coolest a female egg hatched was 84.20. That is why sand temperature affects whether leatherback eggs are female or male.
75925102,10,2,1,The highest temperature was in 2002. The lowest temperature was in 1968. On my graph the temperature was going up and down not just a line going down. If anything the temperature is going up for 1960.
75925106,0,1,0,most shows that the tep is difrent but they still grow the samw
75925106,0,2,0,it has mostly changed
75925106,11,1,0,I think that the  sand tempechure WONT change wether  a sea tuttle haches a boy or girl. Becauls i looked at the data tabelle and saw that mostly  regardles of the  temechure ita an even chance.
75925106,11,2,0,I looked  at the smallest tempshore and it is 2002 Wich i found helpfullbeculs  IT means it is NOT decreasing if 1960 is only 8456
75925112,1,1,0,I think sand temperature affects leatherbacks so they hatch as male or female. Temperature from as low as 84.20 to as hi as 88.08. Males are as low as 80.60 and as hi as 85.19.
75925112,1,2,0,it is not true in 1960 the temperature was 84.56 and in 2016 it was 85.57.
75925112,11,1,0,I think sand temperature affects leatherbacks so they hatch as male or female. Temperature from as low as 84.20 to as hi as 88.08. Males are as low as 80.60 and as hi as 85.19.
75925112,11,2,0,it is not true in 1960 the temperature was 84.56 and in 2016 it was 85.57.
75925114,0,1,0,"I think it's true because, I think that when it's hot the chrysalis is more likly to be wanting to get out of the chrysalis. The butter fly could also be wanting to dry it's wings on the sun ( because it's hot.)"
75925114,0,2,0,"I think this claim is false because, when you look at the graph, the count is not the same, in the years. In 1997, this is the most of the butter flys had been there.(in Mexico.)"
75925114,11,1,0,"If you put the temperature from lowest to highest and look at the male/  female collem, the low temperature is female, and the male is in the high temperature."
75925114,11,2,0,"When we look at the  year, then at the temperature, we can see that in 1960 the temperature was high, but it said that the temperature in Raine Island was decreasing, which means that it was going down."
75925123,0,1,0,I think the temperature affects the monarch butterfly because when i changed the temperature to highest to lowest i saw that in the 60s i saw that they were all mostly chrysalis and when the the temperature is lower they are caterpiler.
75925123,0,2,0,that is not true because some numbers were is the 900s and some were only in the 100s so it was all mixed up so i would not say it was about the same.
75925123,1,1,0,I think the temperature affects the monarch butterfly because when i changed the temperature to highest to lowest i saw that in the 60s i saw that they were all mostly chrysalis and when the the temperature is lower they are caterpiler.
75925123,1,2,0,that is not true because some numbers were is the 900s and some were only in the 100s so it was all mixed up so i would not say it was about the same.
75925131,0,1,0,some of the chrysalis are at the 56 degree mark but most of them are from 60 to
75925131,0,2,0,on my graph is doesn't look like the population is the same because it keeps going up and down not a steady amount each year
75925131,1,1,0,some of the chrysalis are at the 56 degree mark but most of them are from 60 to
75925131,1,2,0,on my graph is doesn't look like the population is the same because it keeps going up and down not a steady amount each year
75925133,1,1,0,some caterpiller's and chrysalis live in the same location and some are growing faster than others
75925133,1,2,1,because it is not staying the same actully it is getting lower
75925133,10,1,0,I looked at the chart and saw a female and male turtle that live in different places but same temputure
75925133,10,2,1,In 1968 the temperature was 83.75 and in 2002 the temperature was 86.72 so it was going higher
75925139,1,1,1,I think the claim is true because the graph shows that the highest temperature shows that the catupiler is in its chrysalis the coldest temperature the butterfly was still a catipiller.
75925139,1,2,0,in 2018 there was 302 and in 1995 there where 630 and in 1996 there was 909 and in 2013 there was 33 so I think that that claim is false.
75925139,10,1,1,"the males are at the bottom and some in the middle, the females are at the top there are three in the middle. Also it said in the beginning that the temperature determines if they are male or female."
75925139,10,2,0,in 1960 it was 84.56 (f) then in 2016 it was 85.57 (f). that is why.
75925142,10,1,1,"When I was looking at the evidince, I noticed that all of the males were in sand of the temperature 85.19, and lower. all of the females were born at the temperature of 84.20 and higher. So to conclude the males are born at colder temperatures, and the females were born at slightly warmer temperatures."
75925142,10,2,0,"The claim is that temperature of the the sand in Raine has been decreasing since 1960. I think that it is sort of true, because the highest the highest temp. that the sand reached was 86.72. that was in 2002. the lowest temp. that the sand reached was 83.75, that was in 1968. so the sand has been getting to temps. in between both those numbers."
75925149,0,1,1,I found that the butterflies grow more in warmer weather.   The butterflies in 54 degrees were still in the caterpillar stage.  But in the 62 degree range they were in the chrysalis stage.  That shows they grew more.
75925149,0,2,0,I think this is false because the count goes from like 90 to 400 to 30.  On the graph it goes from 50 to 200 to 900.  900 is the most.  If it stayed the same most of the data would be in a line.
75925149,11,1,1,The data shows that in higher temperatures females are normally hatched.  In lower temperatures male are normally hatched.
75925149,11,2,0,The temperature has been increasing not decreasing. The graph helps me see that.
75925155,0,1,0,sample ones temp is 56.84 and is a catapiller.sample twos temp is 59.54 and is a christallis.
75925155,0,2,0,Sample one has 33.50 million buterflies.Sample number 8 has 145.50. The numbers go higher every sample number.
75925155,1,1,0,sample ones temp is 56.84 and is a catapiller.sample twos temp is 59.54 and is a christallis.
75925155,1,2,0,Sample one has 33.50 million buterflies.Sample number 8 has 145.50. The numbers go higher every sample number.
75925159,0,1,1,I know the temperature of the monarch butterfly's habitat affects how quickly it goes through its life cycle stages is because when I sort the data by cold to hot and most of the hot temperature was the chrysalis meaning they do better in hot places
75925159,0,2,0,"the monarch population staying the same is false because looking at my data, the numbers are nowhere near eachother"
75925159,11,1,1,I think this is false because the temperatures are around the same number in the 80's.
75925159,11,2,0,"This answer is false because looking at the temperature range, it's staying in the same range from 1960 and up.\n"
75925167,1,1,1,I am seeing that the life cycle IS affected by the temp. of their habitat.\nSome evidence that my claim is true is that 60 Degrees *f is when they start turning in to caterpillers but over 60 is chryalises.
75925167,1,2,0,Looking at my data I desided that I would make it into a graph. \nThen I set the Y axis to sample number and X axis to year then I added a trend line and saw the data going down hugely. It went from 909.50 to 33.50.
75925167,10,1,1,One reason why I think that is partly true partly false is if that were true then either 1 or 25 would NOT be the same gender as they are because number 1 (85.80) is only .61 hotter than 25 (85.19). I think it is partly true to because the the data shows Females average 85 and a half maybe more and also shows the Males average 84 and a half so that is why I think that it is partly true and partly false.
75925167,10,2,0,because in the 1990s there was maybe half 84 and half 85 but in the 2000s it is  more 84 than 85 I sorted it by year so I could see the difrence between years in order I just checked if it was not just the 2000s they were talking about but it did not matter.
75925171,1,1,0,so on my chart i changed it to temp and it shows the colder it is the more likely to become a Caterpillar faster then the hotter places in the hotter places they are still in there chrysalis so it does affect how fast it goes through the life cycle and if i were a butterfly i would want to live in a colder place because i'm impatient.
75925171,1,2,0,well back when they first started keeping track it was the highest number and it was still really high then it was all over the place so it wasn't the same or it would have roughly the same numbers by years but they are just all over the place so i think they are wrong.
75925171,10,1,0,the importent info sayes the tempecher efects the gender.  its right because with my evedence it effects the turtles by gender.it also sayes that the temp efects the turtules in the story.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ns
75925171,10,2,0,astralias nesting area is the most importent nesting area so it cant be decresing
75925174,1,1,1,I think this claim is false because if you see on the data when monarch butterfly's  are inside they can be a caterpillar or a chrysalis. But on the outside it shows that it can be the same as the indoor. Also as you can see lower temperatures and higher temperatures can both be caterpillars or chrysalis's. So I don't believe the temperature affects them or the habitat.
75925174,1,2,1,I think this claim is false because as the years go on the temperatures are not staying about the same. Sometimes one year is millions more than the other. Through out the year it has gone up and down with less millions and more millions. So I believe this claim is false.
75925174,10,1,1,I think this claim is partly true and partly false. I think this because if you look at the males most of them have lower temperatures than the females. Most males are 85 to 80 for their temperatures. As you see most females are 85 and up. But some males are higher than 85 and some females are lower than 85. But as you see most females are higher than 85 and most males are lower than 85.
75925174,10,2,1,I think this claim is false because at 1960 it was 84.56. But if you look at my evidence two years after it was 85.10. Through the years the temperature has been getting higher and is not decreasing. Also the temperature got up to 86.72 which has not decreased from 1960. So the temperature of the sand in Raine Island is not decreasing.
75925180,1,1,1,"Well, when I sorted the data by temperature lowest to highest, I looked at the life cycle stages and first there were a chunk of caterpillar  and then chrysalis  then more caterpillars back and fourth. I think that if the claim was true then all the caterpillars would be together and all the chrysalis would be together."
75925180,1,2,0,"I put every year in order and then looked at the count (millions). Then, I realized that there were numbers of all different places. Some were higher and some were lower. For example, in 2009, the amount was 96.00 and in 1996, the monarch count was 909.50."
75925180,10,1,1,The highest temparatures of sand are normally when females are born. The lowest tempatures are mostly male.
75925180,10,2,0,"I think that because the temperature goes higher and lower at all different years. For example, in 1960 the temperature of the sand was 84.56 and in 1962 the temperature was 85.10 which is higher then before."
75925182,0,1,1,the weather makes the monarch slow done if it is to cold out they stay as caterpillars and when it is hot they grow up faster.\n They grow faster if they eat more.\nthey grow slow if it is 61 to 54 farinhite\nmost of theyse are still caterpillars because it is still cold
75925182,0,2,0,In 1996 there were 909.50 mil butterflies. But in 2013 there were 33.50 mill and that is not a lot.
75925188,10,1,1,I see that the males mostly hatch in a little colder sand. I also see that the females are mostly born in sand that is a little bit warmer then the males. I think that the fact is partly true because that is not true for some of the turtles.
75925188,10,2,1,I think this statement is false because I put the temperature in a graph and it seemed to be incresing.
75925190,10,1,1,I think it is partly true party false. If you look at the claim it is (the sand temperature affects weather leatherback eggs hatch as male or female.) Then look at the chart male temperature is from 85.19 to 80.60. Then look at female the temperature is from 88.8 to 84.20 so to me it looks like that if there is a higher temperature then there is a female and a lower temperature for a male. But I only think it is partly true partly false because the temperatures 84 and 85 are both in range for them both.
75925190,10,2,1,"I think it is false. So look at the chart at 1960 the temperature is 84.56 but almost every year after that it has been 85 or 86 but some have been 84 but most are higher on 84. But on 1964,1970 and 1972 are all lower but it said that it has been decreasing since 1960 which means every year after that but way more are higher plus the last year is 85.57 which is also higher."
75925202,1,1,1,I think that it is true because when the temperature is higher there are mostly chrysalis and when it is colder there are more caterpilers.
75925202,1,2,1,I think that it is false because when it is winter all of the butterflys go to  Mexico. So wen they go there every winter the population will go up.
75925202,10,1,1,I think it is true because a lot of the low temperatures are males and high is mostly female.
75925202,10,2,1,I think it is false because the graph shows that it is increasing insted of decreasing.\n
75925203,1,1,1,I think this claim is true because the caterpillars that were in warmer places have already gone to chrysalis stage. where as the other ones are still in caterpillar stage.
75925203,1,2,0,I think this claim is false because there is a lot of variety each year. for example in 2009 there were 96 million butterflies and in 2010 there were 201 million butterflies.
75925203,10,1,1,"I believe that the sand temperature affects whether leatherback eggs hatch as male or female and here's why. because the lower 80s are mostly male the middle temp. 80s are a good mix, and the high 80s are mostly female."
75925203,10,2,0,I think the claim is partly true because the temp. of the sand kind of went up and down.
75925204,1,1,0,If you look at the table you will see that if it is most likely to be warm the turtle will be a female. Because I looked at all of the temperature and the temp is high if it is a female. If the temperature is on the cooler side then that means that the turtle will be a male. All of the temperatures that show males have a lower temperature than the females. And females have a higher temperature than the males. So I think when it is warmer it will be a female and when it is cooler it will be a male.
75925204,1,2,0,If you look closely you will see that the temperature is also  increasing but as the year goes past the temperature is decreasing.It is doing both increasing and decreasing because if you look at the last two temperatures you will see that it will decrease but the very last one is increasing.
75925204,11,1,0,If you look at the table you will see that if it is most likely to be warm the turtle will be a female. Because I looked at all of the temperature and the temp is high if it is a female. If the temperature is on the cooler side then that means that the turtle will be a male. All of the temperatures that show males have a lower temperature than the females. And females have a higher temperature than the males. So I think when it is warmer it will be a female and when it is cooler it will be a male.
75925204,11,2,0,If you look closely you will see that the temperature is also  increasing but as the year goes past the temperature is decreasing.It is doing both increasing and decreasing because if you look at the last two temperatures you will see that it will decrease but the very last one is increasing.
75925205,1,1,1,"i think this claim is true because when the temperature  is warmer most of the butterflies stay inside. When, the temperature is colder most of them stay outside to make there chrysalis."
75925205,1,2,1,i think this claim is false because the data table shows that as years go on the population have been increasing and decressing. Also thats happening because butterflies go there when it gets to cold or to hot where they live and it degreses when they leave to go somewhere else.
75925205,10,1,1,I think it is true because male eggs like the sand cooler then female eggs like the sand .The male eggs like 80 to 85 degrees and female like it 84 to 88 degrees.
75925205,10,2,1,"I made a graph to show whether the tempature has been decreasing or not and the graph showed me that the weather has been increasing. So, it is false the weather has not been decreasing"
75925214,0,1,1,I think the claim is true because in the information I recently got almost all the lowest are outside of the chrysalis and some off the highest are still inside of the chrysalis so my point is that the higher the temperature the longer your in the chrysalis.
75925214,0,2,0,I think claim 2 is false because the population is going up a lot and is almost up to 1000 so i so not think claim 2 is telling the truth.
75925214,11,1,1,I think that claim 1 is true because when the sand gets hot its most likely that a female will hatch. So when it gets colder some of the males will be born so what I am saying is whenever the sand gets hot a female comes out. Whenever the sand is cold and warm a male will come out.
75925214,11,2,0,If you look at the chart the year 1960 is lowest but then it is increasing not decreasing so I think that claim 2 is false.
75925216,0,1,1,"I think this claim is true because, when I organized the data by temperature, I saw some patterns. First, when the eggs were in the 54 - 59.36 degree range, they were all caterpillars. Second, when the eggs were in the 59.37 - 60.90 degree range, they were a mixture of caterpillars and chrysalises. Lastly, when the eggs were in the 60.91 - 64 degree range, they were all chrysalises. That is why I think the claim is true. The temperature of a monarch butterfly's habitat does affect how quickly it goes through its life cycle stages."
75925216,0,2,0,
75925219,1,1,1,I think it's partly true/partly false because from the data outside is kind of warmer then inside and in the higher tempertures the monarchs are already at the chrysalis stage. In the article it said that monarchs move to warmer places in the winter. Places that are not to cold and not to warm. But I also think it is partly false too because looking at the data some monarchs that are inside are in chrysalis.
75925219,1,2,0,I think it's false because in the data It looks like the population for monarch in Mexico is decreaseing. In 1993 the population of monarch in Mexico was 311.50. I think it was increasing and now it is decreasing. The highest year on the data chart is 2017 the population is 124.00 in 2017.
75925219,10,1,1,The higher temperature are mostly female and the lower temperature are mostly male. I said partly true partly false because some male sea turtles are high temperatures and some female sea turtles are in the lower temperatures.
75925219,10,2,0,On the chart after 1960 it sometimes get higher and sometimes lower.
75925220,1,1,0,"I think it is partly true partly false, its partly true because i realize that female baby turtles are born with higher tempatures and males are born with lower tempatures, and I can understand that. But I also think its partly false because number 2 (male) has 85.04, and number 28 (female) has a tempature in the range of 84, so does number 3 and number 9. Im a little confused of what this means and I think that if females are born in that area, the should be males."
75925220,1,2,0,"I think that this piece of evidence is partly true partly false too, because the island off of Australia is getting warmer but I also notice that its not, in 2002 the tempature was 86.72, but in 2010,12,and 16 the tempature was in the 85's, So it went down. Plus, it's just an island off of Australia. That doesn't mean that the whole country is having there tempature increasing."
75925220,11,1,0,"I think it is partly true partly false, its partly true because i realize that female baby turtles are born with higher tempatures and males are born with lower tempatures, and I can understand that. But I also think its partly false because number 2 (male) has 85.04, and number 28 (female) has a tempature in the range of 84, so does number 3 and number 9.

Plus, it's just an island off of Australia. That doesn't mean that the whole country is having there tempature increasing."
75925223,0,1,1,Because most of the lower temps. are caterpillars and most of the higher temps. are chrysalis.
75925223,0,2,0,Because the lowest amount of butterflies was in 2013 and their was 33.50 . In the middle is 2008 and their was 253.00. then the largest amount was in 1996 and their was 909.50 butterflies!
75925231,0,1,1,"The lower the temperature is, the slower the life cycle goes."
75925231,0,2,0,Each year there's a little bit of a difference and sometimes it stays the same. In 1993 when scientists started estimating butterfly population the population was about 311.50 and the lowest one was in 2013 and it was 33.50.
75925231,11,1,1,The higher the temperature is the higher the chance it's going to be a female. The lower the temperature is the higher  chance it has to be a Male leatherback.
75925231,11,2,0,It is false because the sand temperature keeps on going to 84 to 85. It starts at 84 then went up to 85 in 2016 so it's going up and not down.
75925246,1,1,0,I think the first claim is partly right and partly wrong because if you look at the data close enough you will see that the highest temperature is 63.14 and the life cycle stage is a chrysalis and as the temperature goes down you see that the life cycle stage has changed into a caterpillar so the life cycle of stage of the butterflies is taking a bit longer.
75925246,1,2,1,I think that the second claim is wrong because if you look at the chart close  enough you will see that the butterfly population is increasing in Mexico its not staying the same because if you at the chart under the word count the numbers show that the population is increasing not staying the same.
75925246,10,1,0,its partly true because sea turtles do lay there eggs in the sand its partly false because the sand temperature does not help the eggs hatch into a boy or a girl
75925246,10,2,1,its false because the temperature did not go down it went up
75925249,0,1,1,it does affect how quickly it goes through the life cycle \nbecause there are more chrysalis in the warmer weather so the colder weather makes it harder for them to go through life cycle stages.
75925249,0,2,0,the population has moved around a lot because it has gone all the way from 33.50 to 909.50 and that is a big difference.
75925249,11,1,1,The reason why I think it is false is because it the data there is about the same amount of male and female turtles in each location. I also think this because in the data there is not much proof that the temperature affects the gender of the turtle.
75925249,11,2,0,"I said it is false because when I looked at the data as the year went higher the temperature moving up. For example, in 1960 the temperature was 84 degrees and in 2014 it was 86 degrees."
75925255,0,1,1,"Most of the chrysalis's are in warmer temps and most of the caterpillars are in cooler temps however, there are a noticeable amount of caterpillars in with  the chrysalis's."
75925255,0,2,0,"There is no patteren of the population, and the numbers deffenetly aren't the same."
75925259,0,1,1,I think that wen it gets hoter it seams that the speasheas gros faster as you see in the graf.
75925259,0,2,1,I think that the graf macs it clear that the populaeshun is going down.
75925259,11,1,1,I think that wen the sand is wormer the lether back trtals are more likly to be feamael becas the chart shows that in wormer temichers the tertals are feamale
75925259,11,2,1,I think that the temicher has been increasing over the years and with clow 1 it shows that feamaels thriv in wormnes so if it is incresing in tempicher then there will be more feamael then mael and that is why thay are in daenger.
75925260,1,1,1,"up high has mostly chrysalis and down below is all catapilar starting at sample number 3, inside, 59.36 degrees. however there are a few catapilars up above too."
75925260,1,2,1,this fact is false because as i move down the data chart from beginning to end it starts at 33.50 and goes to 909.50 the count of butterfly's in Mexico have gone way up.
75925260,10,1,1,according to the chart higher temperatures seem to have female eggs and lower the temperatures seem to have more male. but in the middle of the chart mae and female are a little mixed up.
75925260,10,2,1,"on the chart, the temperature has gone not far down and pretty far up. i see that the temp has gone mostly up so it is not decreasing too much."
75925274,0,1,0,"I think it is partly true/ partly false. I think this  if you look at the data, it will go back and fourth between chrysalis and caterpillar. Right in the middle of the data it goes back and fourth. there will sometimes be a caterpillar in the beginning. I believe that it could help to study the location of the butter fly. and if it is inside or outside a building/structure."
75925274,0,2,0,"When I sorted the graph by year, I relized that is g from 33.50 to 302.50!!! i think that the population of butter flies is just rising and falling. If the population is about the same how did it go from 33.50 to 302.50 in five years?! I completely disagree with the statement about the population."
75925274,11,1,0,"I know the claim is partly true and partly false. I know this because The hot sand produces females and cold sand produces male turtles. the partly part is because in the middle of the graph, it's a mix of male, and female babies. I sorted it this way because the question was on the temperature of sand."
75925274,11,2,0,I know that this claim is false. I know this because the temperature is barley changing. Over all the temperature is increasing rather than decreasing. This claim is opposite from the truth.
75925276,1,1,0,"I think this is partly true and partly false because, when I sorted the data lowest temperature to highest, the lowest temperatures had mostly caterpillars. When I looked at the higher temperatures it had mostly chrysalises.There were still a few caterpillars in the high temperatures so I think this fact is partly true,partly false"
75925276,1,2,0,"When I sorted the data by year(lowest to highest), I found that the amount has increased and then decreased through the years. It has not stay really stayed the same."
75925276,10,1,0,when i sorted the temperatures from lowest to highest it the males and females were mixed up. so i think that this would be partly true partly false
75925276,10,2,0,when I sorted the temperatures from lowest to highest the highest temperature was in 2002 so i do not think they have been going down since 1960
75925282,0,1,1,The top of the Life Cycle Stage List where it is colder has all caterpillars and at the bottem of the list where it is hotter has a lot of chrysalis's \n\nI think that when it is warmer they go threw their stages faster and when it is colder they go threw their stages slower
75925282,0,2,0,In 1996 909.50M butterflies were in Mexico but in 2013 only 33.50 butterflies were in Mexico that is a big difference so it has not stayed about the same.
75925282,11,1,1,The table shows that lower temperatures are males and higher temperatures are female
75925282,11,2,0,The years are going up and the temperature is not getting warmer or colder it is staying in the 83.0-87.0 range
75925288,0,1,1,In the data shown in the picture it looks like the lower the temperature the slower the life cycle is.The data also shows the higher the temperature the faster the life cycle is.
75925288,0,2,0,"In my graph since the year 1993 it has rapidly increased, rapidly decreased, and mediocrity decreased. Which is the exact opposite of the scientists claims."
75925288,11,1,1,I think this is partly true and partly false because their is one section where the graph doesn't support the claim of sand temperature effecting the gender. The graph also shows that the claim cant be fully false.
75925288,11,2,0,I believe the claim is false because in my graph the temperature has shown increase from the year 1960.
75925290,1,1,0,of you look at sort by Temperature high to low you will find that if it 85 degreas and up it will be a female and 84 degreas and lower is mail.
75925290,1,2,0,If you sort it by year you will see that it achuly got two digreas warmer.
75925290,11,1,0,of you look at sort by Temperature high to low you will find that if it 85 degreas and up it will be a female and 84 degreas and lower is mail.
75925290,11,2,0,If you sort it by year you will see that it achuly got two digreas warmer.
75925293,1,1,0,If you look at number 26 the temperature is 63.14 and the butterfly is in its chrysalis but if you look at number 29 the butterfly is a caterpillar
75925293,1,2,0,In 1993 there was about 316 butterflies but in 2018 there was about 300 butterflies\n
75925293,10,1,0,3 males were born in very hot sand and 2 females were born in cold\nsand
75925293,10,2,0,in 2008 the temperature is 85.21 but in 2002 the temperature is 86.72
75925297,0,1,0,I think that this is false because when you are a caterpillar you are not inside of you egg or chrysalis. And it says that when the caterpillar is in their chrysalis then are outside of their chrysalis. So like they are not even in it.
75925297,0,2,0,I think that this is false because the scientists are saying that that the population of the butterflies has been about the same in Mexico for the years that they have been counting then. I think that that is false because each year you can see that the population has been going up by millions over these past years. If you look at the evedence you can see that the population has gone way up. {By a LOT}
75925297,11,1,0,"I think that it may be true because the highest temperature was a female and the lowest temperatures were all male. But i'm not positive all of the way because when the temperature got to around 84 degrees, it switched into like a pattern of male female male female female and then went onto the rest of the temps witch were only male."
75925297,11,2,0,I think that this claim is false because in the graph  made it shows that it did go down on the third year but then it started to increase sense then and it does not seem like it is going down any where.
93835102,10,1,0,I think its true because males and females are different just like a girl and boys are different and turtles need the right temperature to have baby turtles yes playa and suriname is a place that I dont know it is very warm 80 degres of the sand is very warm for baby turtles baby turtles need the same temperature same of the two places have different temps turtles are babys the sand might be too hot or too cold turtles need the right place the also need the weather to be warm to go in the cold water because the water will be even more cold if there is not sun the water will be warm
93835102,10,2,0,I think its true because number 1 is 2002 its 86.72 and number 14 its 1968 its 83.75 its getting lower and I know Deccriceing means going down
93835107,0,1,0,Because it is true
93835107,0,2,0,Because it is not straight line.
93835114,0,1,1,When the temperature is higher the butterfly is turning into a chrysalis and soon the chrysalis is turning into a monarch butterfly.
93835114,0,2,0,The numbers of the butterfly is not the same
93835119,10,1,0,because I said so
93835119,10,2,0,"The temperature of the sand in Raine Island, Australia has been decreasing since 1960."
93835120,0,1,0,i think that this is false because when the temptures are higher it take longer and most people would think that it would go faster because there is more food.
93835120,0,2,0,I think its false because the numbers go up and down and up down each year.
93835133,0,1,1,I think this question is true because when the temperatures are getting warmer there are lots of chrysalis'. But when it is a little colder out there are mostly caterpillars.
93835133,0,2,0,"in 1996 the butterfly population in Mexico was 909.50 million. But scientists say that the population has always been about the same?! thats not possible. Because the earliest time they have so far is in 2018. and in 2018 there were only 302.50 million butterfly\'s. So i think the scientist who stated this is very off. 909.50 compared to 302.50 is a big difference, the butterfly population in Mexico has not ""stayed the same."""
93835142,0,1,0,i think that it is incstre but false\n
93835142,0,2,0,the reson i think this is false is becuse maxco that not manicer come to  \nmain
93835146,0,1,0,"it can tack longer for some butterfly's to go in to a chrysalis, then others."
93835146,0,2,1,Each year the count goes done

93835159,10,2,0,86.72 it hier than 85.21\n\n\n\n   86.72=2020 .     85.21=2008
93835174,0,1,0,i think this because everything is different and if it is true when its inside and 59 above it does seem a little true.
93835174,0,2,0,yes because i looked at the map type thing and if i'm right it shows the population of the monarch butterfly.the map gives me a good way of seeing the population and im going with that the population is the same now than it was.
93835176,10,1,1,"I think that the temperature affects the turtle eggs hatching male or female because as you can see on my graph, most of the lower temperatures are male, and the higher temperatures are female."
93835176,10,2,0,I think that the sand temperature in Raine Island has not been decreasing since 1960 because the temperature numbers have just kind of been scattered around after I organized the data by year.
93835180,10,1,0,it is arowed the same temp
93835180,10,2,0,it is going dowen then it goes up up up it decrest ones then got even better\n
93835188,10,1,1,"I think this claim is true because when the temperature rises, there seem to be more females. between 84.20-85.19 it is kinda scattered but in general, it seems like the lower the temp. the more males, but the higher the temp. the more females. since this claim doesn't go into many specifics, I think we could say yes, the sand temperature affects the gender of the turtles."
93835188,10,2,0,"I think this claim is false because as you can tell with the years sorted in this order, you can see how the temperatures go up, down, up, down.  I notest that toward the end in the parts the temp raised! I think it's safe to say this claim is false. on the chart, the green circle represents the temp dropping and the blue circle represents the temp rising. these are just two examples of this."
93835193,10,1,0,"I think that it's false, because there most likely  be a way for the sand does the turtles gender's."
93835193,10,2,0,I think its false because of global warming. Global warming would actualy make the geat go up.
93835197,10,1,0,It is true because the temp. is just like the other female temp. so that is why I think it is true.
93835197,10,2,0,It is true because when I put the years from lowest to highest so that is why I think it is true.
94435114,0,1,0,if it was cold it probably not hatch
94435114,0,2,0,so they know what they are doing
94435117,0,1,0,so the temp. helps but not to hot
94435117,0,2,0,because the butterflys make hundreds of more butterflys
94435130,10,1,1,"I think this because if you look at the graph, then you can see that the average of female turtles are born in the warmer temperatures and the male turtles are born in the more cold temperatures."
94435130,10,2,0,I think this because the graph didn't show anything about the turtle amount.\n
94435136,0,1,0,how it migerates it changes treaw the wind
94435136,0,2,0,it is because the lay a baby evrey 1 mounth
94435136,11,1,0,because they just don't just lay girl turtle
94435136,11,2,0,because it is warm water
94435159,0,1,0,if its cold or if its a bigger egg it will hatch more slow if its a bigger or more cold cattipiler will stay in to keep worm
94435159,0,2,0,its more worm down in mexico
94435159,11,1,0,there are no other resons
94435159,11,2,0,global wurming
94435170,10,1,0,it dose not mater.
94435170,10,2,0,it is true.
94435182,1,1,0,Beacues the heat does not damage it but it could
94435182,1,2,0,because more monarch butterfly's are coming in to Mexico
94435182,10,1,0,because the sometimes they will momentarily leave the area
94435182,10,2,0,the global warming is effecting the sand which makes it to hot
