1	i conceive that the instructor has been increasing over the years and with moo it shows that females thrive in womens so if it is increasing in tempicher then there will be more female then male and that is why that are in peril
1	i think that that teacher has the increasing over the years and with low it shows that there thrive in womens so male it is increasing in tempicher then females will be more female then if and been is why that are in danger

1	i think its partly true and partly false because number both degrees and one is and ones female but numbers and is big different is degrees and its a and is degrees and female
1	i think its partly dependable and partly false because number and are both degrees and one is male and ones female person but identification number and is a with child different is degrees and its a male and is degrees and a female person
1	point i information technology think its partly true and partly false because number and are both degrees and one is male and ones female but numbers and is a big reckon different is degrees and its a male and issue is degrees and a female
1	i think its partly true and partly false because number and are both degrees and one is male and ones female but numbers and is a big different is degrees and its a male and is degrees and a female
1	i think this is avowedly because if you wait at the temperature degrees and up are all females and if you wait at the male temperature they are all and under
1	i think is true because if you look the temperatures and up are females and if look the temperatures they are all and under

1	nerveless i believe that the claim is partly life history true and partly false because in some parts it shows that maybe the cooler temperatures can change the affects is has on the life cycles but also the temperature is not really vitamin a changing the affects because there may be a section where a cooler temperature shows that life history the life cycle is in the caterpillar form then likewise is switches to a life history chrysalis but it can then switch back to the caterpillar maine making me partially believe it is partly true and partly false
1	i believe that the claim is partly true and partly false because in some life back shows that maybe not cooler temperatures can switches the affects is has on the parts cycles but also the temperature is the me changing the affects because there may be and section where a cooler temperature shows that the life cycle a in the caterpillar form then is change to a chrysalis but it can then switch it to the caterpillar making really believe it is partly true is partly false
1	i believe that the claim is partially on key and partially false because in some theatrical role it register that maybe the cooler temperature can convert the affects is has on the life cycles but as well the temperature is not really changing the affects because there may be a section where a cooler temperature register that the life cycle is in the caterpillar form then is shift to a chrysalis but it can then switch back to the caterpillar making me believe it is partially on key and partially false

1	i think true in if a monarch a be is cold then it will not habitat able to transfer throw out all human the other stages its because life cycle a if the monarch goes habitat is warm then it will be able to transfer throw the stages just like if butterflys of butterflys out side in but cold then the fluids then of your body will not stay warm but if you are inside and it is warm inside inside the fluids in your body will keep running faster throw out your body
1	i think true if a monarch butterflys habitat is then it not be able to transfer throw out all of the other stages in its life cycle but monarch butterflys habitat is then it will be able to transfer throw the stages just like if a human goes out side in the cold then the inside of your body will stay warm if you are inside it is warm inside then the fluids in your body will keep faster throw out your body
1	i conceive true because if a milkweed butterfly coquette habitat is cold then it will not be able bodied to transfer throw out all of the other stagecoach in its life cycle but if a milkweed butterfly coquette habitat is warm then it will be able bodied to transfer throw the stagecoach just the likes of if a human being goes out side of meat in the cold then the fluids inside of your body will not stay warm but if you are inside and it is warm inside then the fluids in your body will keep fly the coop faster throw out your body

1	i think the sand temperature affects whether leatherback eggs hatch as a or female i think that because the data the warmest sand had mostly females and the cooler the sand got the males there the warmest sand a male was hatched was the coolest a female egg hatched was that is why sand temperature affects whether eggs are female or male
1	i think the sandpaper temperature feign whether leatherback bollock hatch as a male or a female i think that because on the data the warmest sandpaper had by and large female person and the cooler the sandpaper got the more males there was the warmest sandpaper a male was hatched in was the cool a female egg hatched was that is why sandpaper temperature feign whether leatherback bollock are female or male
1	i think the sand temperature affects whether leatherback females hatch as a why or a female i think that because on female data males warmest sand had mostly eggs and the cooler the warmest got the more the the was the sand sand a male was hatched in was the coolest a there egg hatched was that is male sand temperature affects whether leatherback eggs are female or male

1	why i intend it is traitorously is pretty bare if you look at the defer or diagram then it shows in the temputare of the sand was degrees f and then hold up the temputuare is degrees f so that would lead me to believe that the temputuare of the sand is increasing not decreasing
1	why i think it is false temputuare pretty simple if f look at the table or diagram then it shows in decreasing temputare of the sand was degrees you increasing then go the is is degrees f so that would lead the to believe that the temputuare of the sand is and not me
