0	I think that the temperature effects how quickly it goes threw its life cycle stages partly true/partly false. Because when it is inside it has no place to do its stages and its temperature is to high or low. Also, It is different when its a chrysalis because, whether inside or outside its about the same temperature either way.
1	I think this claim is true because all the females numbers are within a couple of numbers of each other. And it is the same for male.I think this because in the data it says on one piece of evidence that it was 85.82 degrees and it was a female then another one said 85.54 and that was a female. another reason i think this is because in the data it says 80.56 and it was a male then another one said 80.60 and that was a male to.in conclusion I think claim 1 is true.
1	I think this claim is true because whether sea turtles lay there eggs in the sand and the different temperatures that effect in there eggs shell could change there formation of themselves. To turn into to a male or female. Also I notice that the temperatures stay in the eighties maybe  that also has something to do with it. Males usually in Surname tend to stat around in under the 85's but females on the other hand stay above an 85 maybe that's a reason the come out male or female.
1	Most of the chrysalis temperatures are 60 degrees and over plus maybe the temperatures have something to do with their migration because the text did say that they premiered lukewarm temperature
0	i dont know add add add add and befriends are bryan tyler adds erin sabre will pickle spammy myself my sleep paralysis demand
0	The temperature changes the gender because when they are first laid they sea turtles are are not formed. The sea turtles are really unidentified
0	I believe that the temperature can maybe change if it is a male or female, but I don't really know.  Some of the results say record that there were 4 males or females in a row at the same place with there temperatures would be different in different places, but they also show in some sections that they can be scattered (one female one day a male a different day). But on the other hand, a female lays there eggs all together in the same place under the sand so the temperature would be very close in the same hole and there are different genders in one hole.  So I think that it can be true or false.
0	If the monarch butterfly goes through the stages fast then it's probably used to doing something fast and not having the patients to do stuff so that's probably one of it's habit
1	i believe that the sand can affect the gender some times because in the data that shows has the highest temperatures on top with the lowest on bottom and almost all of the high temps are female rather than male one of the highest temps is 88.08 and is female as well as 87.09, 86.97, 86.54, 86.26, those are the highest temps and they are all female the lowest temperature of the female in this test is 84.20 but most of the males is 83.31, 83.25, 82.45, 82.29, the highest of the males in this test is 85.19 quite low to the female turtles. I did say that this thought was partly true/partly false for these reasons
0	sample #7 is almost the exact same top as #60
0	the sands temperature in the ocean shore affects if  it will be a boy or a girl who will hatch from the   turtles egg.
0	i think it is false because under the sand the temp is the same even when it is colder above ground
0	I think this claim is true because if its cold the butterflies are gonna want to be in their Chrysalis. Like when you are cold you wouldn't want to be outside in the cold you want to be raped up in your blanket cause its warmer.
1	The sand temperature affects whether leatherback eggs hatch as male or female because looking at the data, males have lower temperatures while the females have more.
0	i think that the statement was true because a butterfly cant be in the cold for as long as a caterpillar can because of the high winds and over the rain or snow coming down with all the hard pressure.
0	I think the claim is false because there were similar temples and it was out of order if it was male or female and in the wild scientists cant control the temper of the beach so why wouldn't there be more of one type of gender
0	?
1	True, because if the sand is cool then it is a male, but if the sand is hot then it is a female.
1	In Playa most of the females sand temperature is higher than the males sand temperature. Like number 1 Playa 85.80 was a female. then number 8 at Playa 80.67 was a male. So it must make a difference if the temperature of the sand is high or low because almost all of the lower ones are male and most of the higher ones are female.
0	because i feel like it is true and
0	Cause the type of turtles only hatch as males
1	"For the first 2 data reports, both ""butterflies"" were outside. 2\'s butterfly was outside in warmer weather, and was a chrysalis already. 1\'s butterfly\'s was in a cooler weather than 2 so warmer weather does speed up the life cycle of a butterfly."
1	Lots of the turtles that were raised in a cooler environment were males. A piece of evidence is from 80.60 to 83.85 are all males. The females are manly in the group with higher temperature. For example from 85.42 to 88.08 are all females.
0	because the male turtles have to stay safe and if we are being honest i don't remember the question
1	If your looking at the chart, the females temperature is much higher than the males but, some of the temperatures are the same for both the genders. Thats why I think its partly true.
0	I think this is false because they are all different temperatures and one of the males temperature is 84.98 and a females is 84.20 so those are almost the same temperature so it does not matter.
1	The temperature of the monarch butterfly's habitat can kind of affect how fast they change if the conditions are to hot they might form faster than if the conditions were cooler. the butterfly's can sometimes be in the sand and if they are lower in the sand they wont get as hot but  the higher up they are in the sand the hotter they will get and might form faster. if they are i sand they can change all kinds of speeds but it can all depends on where they are in the sand.
0	because if its to cold it might freeze, killing the butterfly, and if its to warm or hot it could die of exhaustion or it could over-heat causing the stages of a butterfly to slow down.
0	I think its false because if stage 3 froze than i will take more time to unfree.
0	The temperature of the sand shouldn't affect the eggs because when you look at your data table you can see there is no clear pattern for the temperatures to prove that there is a way for the temperature to affect whether leatherback eggs are hatch as male or female.
0	I think it is true because if it is cold it is harder for them to turn into a butterfly because it is so cold outside. Another example is if it is really hot outside then it would be hard for the crystal to change because it is so hot.
0	Because it takes time for it to go through the stages. The temperature could change it maybe a little bit but not a lot for it to change how quick the stages go by.
0	because the numbers jump all over the place from high to low.So it seems like it doesnt matter what temperature it is
1	The reason why is because the 8th sample was at Playa it was 80.67 degrees and it was a male and the 9th sample it was at the same place and the temperature was 84.20 and it was a female. So the warmer it is it is a female the colder it is it is a male. Every temperature that is over 84 degrees is a female every temperature that is under 84 degrees is a male.
0	hi my name is ................
1	all of the chrysalis are 60 or above and all of the caterpillar are below 59
0	because sea turtles are diving we got to say those sea turtles
0	I believe that the sand temperature affects whether the leather back eggs hatch as a fem. or male.Because in the article it said that scientist sometimes collect the eggs and control the temp. and then check if they are a fem. or male.
0	No because there are all different types of textures and they are both female and male so this claim is false. They all are 80 degree or over.
1	The lower temperature they are in the caterpillar stage and in the higher temperature they are in a chrysalis stage.
1	Normal when the temp is in the 60's they usually are in their chrysalis period of transformation. But one of the chrysalis periods is in the 50 to 59 degree range.
0	Sample 1 & Sample 2 were about the same temp but were Male and Female.But in Sample 23 & 24 the temp was 4 degrees different,but were also Male and Female.
0	because  the sand in the summer id most of the time on the top of the sand is hot but on the bottom, it is cool not super cold then     ? do they lay eggs in the winter
0	It was warm and it grew and it was cold and it grew the same time.
0	maybe it is because of  partly true/ partly False
1	sometimes the female leatherbacks are born around 84 degrees to 87 degrees.
0	Usually, a caterpillar needs its time to hatch into a butterfly. That's whether try to find the best place in a warm and slightly cold place like California and Mexico. If you don't know. On Day 11 the Chrysalis did not hatch faster or slower. It usually stays outside more than inside
0	I think that the temperature faces the cycle us of the  temp difference of the caterpillar and the chrysalis
0	Partly false because I assorted the data table by temperature and some temperatures were the same but they had a different gender. Partly true because from 80-84 they were mostly only male turtles and just a few female turtles. Through 85-88 there was only female turtles.
1	When I was looking at the evidence, I noticed that all of the males were in sand of the temperature 85.19, and lower. all of the females were born at the temperature of 84.20 and higher. So to conclude the males are born at colder temperatures, and the females were born at slightly warmer temperatures.
1	I think this is false because the temperatures are around the same number in the 80's.
1	I see that the males mostly hatch in a little colder sand. I also see that the females are mostly born in sand that is a little bit warmer then the males. I think that the fact is partly true because that is not true for some of the turtles.
1	I think it is true because a lot of the low temperatures are males and high is mostly female.
1	I think the claim is true because in the information I recently got almost all the lowest are outside of the chrysalis and some off the highest are still inside of the chrysalis so my point is that the higher the temperature the longer your in the chrysalis.
1	I think it's partly true/partly false because from the data outside is kind of warmer then inside and in the higher temperatures the monarchs are already at the chrysalis stage. In the article it said that monarchs move to warmer places in the winter. Places that are not to cold and not to warm. But I also think it is partly false too because looking at the data some monarchs that are inside are in chrysalis.
1	The lower the temperature is, the slower the life cycle goes.
1	The higher the temperature is the higher the chance it's going to be a female. The lower the temperature is the higher  chance it has to be a Male leatherback.
1	Most of the chrysalis's are in warmer temps and most of the caterpillars are in cooler temps however, there are a noticeable amount of caterpillars in with  the chrysalis's.
1	I think that wen the sand is former the letter back trials are more likely to be female because the chart shows that in former teachers the portals are female
0	when i sorted the temperatures from lowest to highest it the males and females were mixed up. so i think that this would be partly true partly false
1	The table shows that lower temperatures are males and higher temperatures are female
1	In the data shown in the picture it looks like the lower the temperature the slower the life cycle is.The data also shows the higher the temperature the faster the life cycle is.
0	I think that this is false because when you are a caterpillar you are not inside of you egg or chrysalis. And it says that when the caterpillar is in their chrysalis then are outside of their chrysalis. So like they are not even in it.
0	I think its true because males and females are different just like a girl and boys are different and turtles need the right temperature to have baby turtles yes playa and surname is a place that I dont know it is very warm 80 degree of the sand is very warm for baby turtles baby turtles need the same temperature same of the two places have different temps turtles are baby the sand might be too hot or too cold turtles need the right place the also need the weather to be warm to go in the cold water because the water will be even more cold if there is not sun the water will be warm
1	When the temperature is higher the butterfly is turning into a chrysalis and soon the chrysalis is turning into a monarch butterfly.
0	                 *14/28 are female's in this graph.                        *14/28 are male's in this graph.                        which mean's...it is a 50/50                     chance it is a female and                   50/50 chance it is a male.           by suraiea smith
0	i think this because everything is different and if it is true when its inside and 59 above it does seem a little true.
0	I think that it's false, because there most likely  be a way for the sand does the turtles gender's.
0	It is true because the temp. is just like the other female temp. so that is why I think it is true.
0	how it migrated it changes treat the wind
1	The chart clearly shows the population decrease from 909 million to 33 million and maybe it is due to natural causes or something happened  on the way
0	I think its false because every year its grows to more counts  but in the claim it said the populations stayed the same every year.
0	"I think this is true because in the winter time when they go to liberate I think that most of all butterfly""s go to mexico because it is the most right temperature for the butterfly\'s to stay at mexico longer in the winter."
0	the article said so
0	i dont know
0	Sam
0	False because on the graph the numbers change depending on the years. because 1996 the butterfly rate was really hi and in 2013 it was really low.
0	i think this is false because the evedace shows the number of butter go up
0	This claim is false because there is barely a decline in temperature. If you were to say that there is a decline you would need to know it only drops down 1 degree every few years. In the graph, you can see that in 2000,1994, 1992, 1974, 1988, and 1962, it stays 85 degrees Fahrenheit.
0	i dont now
0	i think that can not fly that fast to my great that are spostohibrnat in a con
0	The reason i said it was partly true was because 2006 2005 2007 where about the same but years like 2018 2017 are not the same at all.
1	I think this statement is false because butterflies dies in a quick amount of time they don't stay around for 17 years and the data on the chart has different numbers leading up to 2013 as you can see it has gone down.
0	I think it would be partly true and partly false because the temperature of the sand and rain   island , Australia UT In TxIN In PROBALEY WUL By RE
0	i think the claim is false because the number of butter flies has changed
0	I really don't know
0	In 1993, when scientists started keeping track, there where 311.50 million Monarchs, but in 2018 there were 302.50 million Monarchs.
0	because i was watching a lamar beam vid and he said titles are mostly laying eggs in kickoff middle temperature  but i believe hed tell us if they were laying eggs in warm whether or cold whether
0	if anything there over populated
0	"I think that this is incorrect information because it states ""...the monarch butterfly population in mexico has stayed about the same.""However, as you see in my graph, through the years the population has gone anywhere from a bit less than 100 million to 900 million!Due to they scattering of the population I believe that in the past recorded years the population hasn\'t decreased, or increased. It has went back and forth, meaning that it is not only healthy, but that it is going on a natural in predictable course.So, in conclusion, claim #2 is completely incorrect."
0	It goes down and goes up
0	I think the numbers change depending like how much food threat or the temperature or the breeding.
0	The temperature seems to go up and down each year. It isn't exactly decreasing, but it does go down a tiny bit each year. But then it will rise again, being back to the temperature it was before. I believe it's partly true, but the temperature rises again in a few years,
1	If you look at the years under the year 2000 they have all smaller temperatures than the sand in the 2000's. So that means that the temperature increased actually.
1	its not the same. the population has jumped around but has gotten smaller. it slowly gets smaller.
0	it has been decreasing but not very fast.
0	The weather is not going down. I know that because in 2002 it was just about the same temperature as it was in 2012.
0	It could be because of rain and the temp in the air around the sand that makes the sand colder. its defiant going down.
0	The number (in millions) goes up every year. that is NOT staying at around the same number.
1	every year since 1996 the monarch butterfly population has gone down every time a new year comes so the butterfly population cannot be the same if in 1996 909.50 million butterflies and the in 2013 there are only 33.50 million they have gone down by about 878 million
0	because of their ar fewer turtles
0	because over the years the count of butterfly's in mexico had increased and decreased alot
0	I don't think the temperature of the sand in Rain Island has been decreasing because in the data it shows that the sand temperature from 1960 all the way up to 2012 has been in a five degree radius from eachother.
0	I think that it is true because they say every winter they migrate Mexico and they estimate the butterfly population every year sense 1993.
0	I think it is partly true because butterfly can stay the same but not that long. I also know that mexico has alot of butterfly.
0	The count of butterflies in mexico go down and up alot. This is due to the evidence on the chart. But mexico seems to have more butterflies in the late 90's. But in the closer years (like 2017 and 2016) they have a fair amount of monarch butterflies.
1	I do not think it has been decreasing because the graph shows otherwise. The data shows the sand going higher from year to year. In 1960 the temperature of the sand was 84.56, and in 2016 (most resent year on graph) the sand was 85.57. So it was not decreasing at all it was actually increasing.
0	They when to know how the left skole goes so they keep track of the butterfly.
0	the
0	because in 1996 there was 909 and a half million and in 2013 there is only 33 and a half million
0	It increases every year
0	I have made a chart so you can see that I am right because they stated.
1	It hasn't stayed about the same because if you look at the amount of butterflies in 1996 is higher and the number just keeps going down and down over the years.
0	in 2016 it was only 85.57 and that isn't too far from 1962 and that was only 85.10 there is only 47-degree difference
0	when they keep tract of them they can see were they are Going
1	the butterfly population has gone down in 1996 it was at 909.50 in. 2013 it is at 33.50.
1	as the years go by they get lesser and lesser from 909 million to 33 million
1	The temupature since 1860 has been going up until 2000s and started to go down and up.
1	The dots on my graph  are all over the place. It goes by the year and count by millions. Some dots are near the bottom and some are near the top. In my chart the numbers range from 33.50 million to 909.50.
1	In 1968 the temperature was 83.75 and in 2002 the temperature was 86.72 so it was going higher
0	in 1960 it was 84.56 (f) then in 2016 it was 85.57 (f). that is why.
0	The temperature has been increasing not decreasing. The graph helps me see that.
0	Looking at my data I decided that I would make it into a graph. Then I set the Y axis to sample number and X axis to year then I added a trend line and saw the data going down hugely. It went from 909.50 to 33.50.
1	I think this claim is false because at 1960 it was 84.56. But if you look at my evidence two years after it was 85.10. Through the years the temperature has been getting higher and is not decreasing. Also the temperature got up to 86.72 which has not decreased from 1960. So the temperature of the sand in Rain Island is not decreasing.
0	I think the claim is partly true because the temp. of the sand kind of went up and down.
0	There is no pattern of the population, and the numbers deffenetly aren't the same.
1	this fact is false because as i move down the data chart from beginning to end it starts at 33.50 and goes to 909.50 the count of butterfly's in Mexico have gone way up.
1	on the chart, the temperature has gone not far down and pretty far up. i see that the temp has gone mostly up so it is not decreasing too much.
0	When I sorted the graph by year, I realized that is g from 33.50 to 302.50!!! i think that the population of butter flies is just rising and falling. If the population is about the same how did it go from 33.50 to 302.50 in five years?! I completely disagree with the statement about the population.
0	I think that this is false because the scientists are saying that that the population of the butterflies has been about the same in Mexico for the years that they have been counting then. I think that that is false because each year you can see that the population has been going up by millions over these past years. If you look at the evidence you can see that the population has gone way up. {By a OT}
0	I think that this claim is false because in the graph  made it shows that it did go down on the third year but then it started to increase sense then and it does not seem like it is going down any where.
0	I think its true because number 1 is 2002 its 86.72 and number 14 its 1968 its 83.75 its getting lower and I know Deccriceing means going down
0	It is true because when I put the years from lowest to highest so that is why I think it is true.
0	it is because the lay a baby every 1 month
