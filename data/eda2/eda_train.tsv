1	i made a graph to show whether the temperature has been fall or not and the graph read me that the weather has been increasing so it is assumed the weather has not been fall
1	i made a graph to show whether me temperature has been decreasing or not and the graph showed the that the not has been increasing so it weather false the weather has is been decreasing
1	i made a graph to show whether the has been decreasing or not and the graph showed me that the weather has so it is false the weather has not been decreasing
1	i made a graph to show whether the temperature has been decreasing or not and the graph showed me that the weather has been increasing so it is false the weather has not been decreasing
1	i think this claim is false because if same see on the data when can butterflys are inside they can a monarch caterpillar can a chrysalis but on the outside it shows habitat it be be the you as the indoor also as you or see lower temperatures and higher temperatures can both be caterpillars or chrysaliss so i dont believe the temperature affects them or the that
1	i think this claim is false because if you see on the data when monarch butterflys are they can be a caterpillar or a chrysalis but on outside it shows that it can be the indoor also as you can see lower temperatures and higher temperatures can both be or so i dont believe the temperature affects or the habitat
1	i think this call is off key because if you see on the data when milkweed butterfly butterflys are inside they can be a cat or a chrysalis but on the outside it shows that it can be the same as the indoor also as you can see lower temperatures and in high spirits temperatures can both be caterpillars or chrysaliss so i dont believe the temperature impress them or the habitat

1	the population went down almost million in only years the butterfly population went down million in one year therefore the population is going down
1	the population extend down almost trillion in only years the butterfly population extend down trillion in one year therefore the population is going down rapidly
1	the went population down million almost in only years the butterfly population went down million in one year therefore the population is going down rapidly

1	i think this claim is partly true and partly false i think because you look at the most of them have lower temperatures than the most males are to for their you see most females are and up but some males are higher than and some females are lower than but as you see most females are higher than and most males lower than
1	i think this claim is partly true and partly false i think this because if you look at the males female person most of them have lower temperatures than the females virtually most virtually depressed males are to for their temperatures temperature just as you see most females are and up but female person some males are higher than and some females are lower than but as you see most females are higher than and most males are lower than
1	i you this partly is claim true and and false i think this because you you look at the males most of them have lower temperatures than the females most males are to for their temperatures as think see most some are and up but some males are higher than as partly females are lower than but females if see most females are higher than and most males are lower than
1	i think this claim is partly true and partly false i think this because if you look at the males most of them have lower temperatures than the females most males are to for their temperatures as you see most females are and up but some males are higher than and some females are lower than but as you see most females are higher than and most males are lower than 
1	i think that reckon the temperature affects the virtually turtle eggs hatching male or female because as you can see on my graph most of the lower temperatures reckon are male and the higher temperatures are female
1	i think that the temperature affects the turtle can hatching male see female because as you eggs temperatures on my graph most of the lower or are male and the higher temperatures are female
1	i think that the temperature affects the capsize eggs hatching male or female person because as you can see on my graph most of the lower temperatures are male and the gamy temperatures are female person
1	i think that the temperature affects the turtle eggs hatching male or female because as you can see on my graph most of the lower temperatures are male and the higher temperatures are female 
1	i think this claim is true because when the temperature temperature warmer most of the of stay inside when the is is colder most butterflies outside stay them to make there chrysalis
1	i think this claim is appease true because when the temperature is warmer most of the butterflies reliable stay inside when the temperature is colder most of them stay stay outside to make there chrysalis
1	i think this take is true because when the temperature is warmer most of the butterflies stay inside when the temperature is colder most of them stay away to lay down there chrysalis
1	i think this claim is true because when the temperature is warmer most of the butterflies stay inside when the temperature is colder most of them stay outside to make there chrysalis 
1	i see can that the female has bigger numbers then the males
1	i can see that the female has bigger numbers then male the males
1	i can see that the distaff has bigger numbers then the males
1	i can see that the female has bigger numbers then the males
1	i think this is partly true and partly false because their is one where the graph doesnt support claim of sand temperature affecting the gender the graph also that the claim cant be fully false
1	i think this is partly true and partly false because their is one part where the graph doesnt support the claim of sand temperature pretend the gender the graph also shows that the claim vernacular be fully false
1	i think this is incite partly true and partly false because their is one section shew where the graph doesnt support the claim of sand temperature affecting the gender the graph also shows that the claim cant be fully move false
1	i think this is partly true and partly false because their is one section where the graph doesnt support the claim of sand temperature affecting the gender the graph also shows that the claim cant be fully false 
1	i think it is partly true party false if you look at the claim is the sand temperature affects weather leatherback eggs hatch as male female then at the chart male temperature to look at temperature is from to so to me it looks like if there is a higher temperature there is a female and a lower temperature for a male but i only think it true partly false because temperatures and are both in range them
1	i think it is partly testicle true party false if you look at the claim atomic number it is the sand temperature affects weather leatherback eggs hatch as inch male or title female then look at the chart male temperature is from to then look at female the temperature is from personify to so to me reckon it looks like that if there is a so higher temperature then there is a female and a lower temperature company for a male but i only think it is partly true partly false because the temperatures and are both information technology in range for them both
1	i recall it is part true company false if you look at the claim it is the sand temperature affects brave leathery turtle egg hatch as male or distaff then look at the chart male temperature is from to then look at distaff the temperature is from to so to me it looks comparable that if there is a higher temperature then there is a distaff and a lower temperature for a male but i only recall it is part true part false because the temperatures and are both in kitchen range for them both
1	i think it is partly true party false if you look at the claim it is the sand temperature affects weather leatherback eggs hatch as male or female then look at the chart male temperature is from to then look at female the temperature is from to so to me it looks like that if there is a higher temperature then there is a female and a lower temperature for a male but i only think it is partly true partly false because the temperatures and are both in range for them both 
1	i if that the second claim is wrong because if you look at the chart close enough you will see that the butterfly population is increasing in mexico its not staying the same numbers think because at the chart under the word count the you show same the population is increasing not staying the that
1	i think that the second claim stay is wrong because if you look at the chart close enough you will see that the butterfly population is increasing in personify mexico its not staying the same because if you at increase the chart wrongfulness under the word count the numbers show that the population is lapp increasing not staying the same

1	think this claim is true because when organized the data by temperature i saw some patterns first when the eggs were in the degree range they were all caterpillars second the eggs were in the degree range they were a mixture of caterpillars chrysalises lastly when eggs were in the degree they were all chrysalises that is why i think the claim is true the temperature of a monarch butterflys habitat affect how quickly it goes through its life cycle stages
1	i reliable think this claim is true because when i personify organized the data by temperature i saw some patterns first when reckon the eggs were personify in the degree range they were all caterpillars second personify when the eggs were in the degree range they were totally a mixture inch of caterpillars and chrysalises lastly when the eggs were in the degree range they were all chrysalises that is why title i think the claim is true the temperature of a monarch butterflys habitat does affect how quickly it goes through its life cycle stages
1	i think this claim is rightful because when i get up the data point by temperature i saw some shape first when the eggs were in the degree range they were all caterpillars second when the eggs were in the degree range they were a mixture of caterpillars and chrysalises lastly when the eggs were in the degree range they were all chrysalises that is why i think the claim is rightful the temperature of a monarch philander habitat does involve how quickly it goes through its life history cycle rat

1	well when i sorted the data by temperature lowest to high i depend at the life time cycle stages and first there were a chunk of caterpillar and then chrysalis then more caterpillars plump for and fourthly i think that if the claim was true then all the caterpillars would be together and all the chrysalis would be together
1	i sorted by temperature highest i looked at the life cycle stages and first there were a of caterpillar and then chrysalis then caterpillars back and fourth i that if the claim was true then all the caterpillars would be together and all the chrysalis be together
1	well when i sorted the data class by temperature lowest to highest i looked at the life cycle stages and first there were a chunk of caterpillar and cycle per second then chrysalis then more caterpillars back and fourth i think that personify if the caterpillar claim was true then all the caterpillars collocate would be together and all the chrysalis would be together

1	i think it is false so look at the but on the temperature is but almost every it after that year it been or but some have been but most been higher at but on the are all lower chart has said that it has are decreasing since which means every year after that but way more are higher plus and last year is which is also higher
1	i think it is false so at the chart at the temperature is but almost every year after that it has been but some have been but most are higher on on and lower but it said that it has been decreasing since which means every year after that but way are higher plus the last year which is also higher
1	i think personify it is false so look at the chart at the temperature is but decrease almost every just year after yr personify that it has been or but some have been but most are higher on but on and are all lower but it said that it has been decreasing since which means every year after that but way more are higher plus the last year is which is also lessen higher

1	because at temperatures higher than the caterpillar be in chrysalis and any lower it was still a caterpillar
1	because at temperatures higher than the caterpillar would be soundless in a chrysalis and temperature any lower it was still a caterpillar
1	because at temperature higher than the cat would be in a chrysalis and any lower it was still a cat
1	because at temperatures higher than the caterpillar would be in a chrysalis and any lower it was still a caterpillar

1	i conceive that the instructor has been increasing over the years and with moo it shows that females thrive in womens so if it is increasing in tempicher then there will be more female then male and that is why that are in peril
1	i think that that teacher has the increasing over the years and with low it shows that there thrive in womens so male it is increasing in tempicher then females will be more female then if and been is why that are in danger

1	i think its partly true and partly false because number both degrees and one is and ones female but numbers and is big different is degrees and its a and is degrees and female
1	i think its partly dependable and partly false because number and are both degrees and one is male and ones female person but identification number and is a with child different is degrees and its a male and is degrees and a female person
1	point i information technology think its partly true and partly false because number and are both degrees and one is male and ones female but numbers and is a big reckon different is degrees and its a male and issue is degrees and a female
1	i think its partly true and partly false because number and are both degrees and one is male and ones female but numbers and is a big different is degrees and its a male and is degrees and a female
1	i think this is avowedly because if you wait at the temperature degrees and up are all females and if you wait at the male temperature they are all and under
1	i think is true because if you look the temperatures and up are females and if look the temperatures they are all and under

1	nerveless i believe that the claim is partly life history true and partly false because in some parts it shows that maybe the cooler temperatures can change the affects is has on the life cycles but also the temperature is not really vitamin a changing the affects because there may be a section where a cooler temperature shows that life history the life cycle is in the caterpillar form then likewise is switches to a life history chrysalis but it can then switch back to the caterpillar maine making me partially believe it is partly true and partly false
1	i believe that the claim is partly true and partly false because in some life back shows that maybe not cooler temperatures can switches the affects is has on the parts cycles but also the temperature is the me changing the affects because there may be and section where a cooler temperature shows that the life cycle a in the caterpillar form then is change to a chrysalis but it can then switch it to the caterpillar making really believe it is partly true is partly false
1	i believe that the claim is partially on key and partially false because in some theatrical role it register that maybe the cooler temperature can convert the affects is has on the life cycles but as well the temperature is not really changing the affects because there may be a section where a cooler temperature register that the life cycle is in the caterpillar form then is shift to a chrysalis but it can then switch back to the caterpillar making me believe it is partially on key and partially false

1	i think true in if a monarch a be is cold then it will not habitat able to transfer throw out all human the other stages its because life cycle a if the monarch goes habitat is warm then it will be able to transfer throw the stages just like if butterflys of butterflys out side in but cold then the fluids then of your body will not stay warm but if you are inside and it is warm inside inside the fluids in your body will keep running faster throw out your body
1	i think true if a monarch butterflys habitat is then it not be able to transfer throw out all of the other stages in its life cycle but monarch butterflys habitat is then it will be able to transfer throw the stages just like if a human goes out side in the cold then the inside of your body will stay warm if you are inside it is warm inside then the fluids in your body will keep faster throw out your body
1	i conceive true because if a milkweed butterfly coquette habitat is cold then it will not be able bodied to transfer throw out all of the other stagecoach in its life cycle but if a milkweed butterfly coquette habitat is warm then it will be able bodied to transfer throw the stagecoach just the likes of if a human being goes out side of meat in the cold then the fluids inside of your body will not stay warm but if you are inside and it is warm inside then the fluids in your body will keep fly the coop faster throw out your body

1	i think the sand temperature affects whether leatherback eggs hatch as a or female i think that because the data the warmest sand had mostly females and the cooler the sand got the males there the warmest sand a male was hatched was the coolest a female egg hatched was that is why sand temperature affects whether eggs are female or male
1	i think the sandpaper temperature feign whether leatherback bollock hatch as a male or a female i think that because on the data the warmest sandpaper had by and large female person and the cooler the sandpaper got the more males there was the warmest sandpaper a male was hatched in was the cool a female egg hatched was that is why sandpaper temperature feign whether leatherback bollock are female or male

0	i think the first claim is partially right and partially legal injury because if you look at the data close adequate you will see that the highest temperature is and the life cycle present is a chrysalis and as the temperature goes down you see that the life cycle present has change into a caterpillar so the life cycle of present of the butterflies is taking a bit retentive
0	i think the first claim is partly right and partly wrong because if you look at the data close enough you will see that the highest temperature is and the life cycle stage is a chrysalis and as the temperature goes down you see that the life cycle stage has changed into a caterpillar so the life cycle of stage of the butterflies is taking a bit longer

0	I think this is false because in 1960 the temperature was 84.56 and the the temperature in 1962 was 85.10 so its been going up not down.

0	If you look at the chart the year 1960 is lowest but then it is increasing not decreasing so I think that claim 2 is false.
0	Yes, because if you look at the temperature it is going down and down more.
0	because for some reason the heat makes the gender different and the turtles know this so they place their eggs in different places accordingly.
0	I think claim 2 is false because the population is going up a lot and is almost up to 1000 so i so not think claim 2 is telling the truth.
