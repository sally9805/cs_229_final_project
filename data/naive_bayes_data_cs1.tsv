Female or Male they go to warm places where temperature go up to 80 degrees. They always go to warmer places	0
I think this clam is true, Because in the story it says the Monarch Butterfly's temperature affects how quickly it goes through its life cycle stages.	0
I think that the temperature effects how quickly it goes threw its life cycle stages partly true/partly false. Because when it is inside it has no place to do its stages and its temperature is to high or low. Also, It is different when its a chrysalis because, whether inside or outside its about the same temperature either way.	0
because if it is could the cocoon is cold then it might freeze and when i am outside in the winter i do not see catpellar's  or butterfly's. In the summer i think it would be much qucker.	1
I think the claim is true because outside it is 56.84 degrees  and the butterfly is in the caterpillar stage. The other one says that it is 59.54 degrees and the butterfly in in it's chrysallis stage.	1
I think this claim is true because all the females numbers are within a couple of numbers of each other. And it is the same for male.\n\nI think this because in the data it says on one piece of evidence that it was 85.82 degress and it was a female then another one said 85.54 and that was a female. \n\nanother reason i think this is because in the data it says 80.56 and it was a male then another one said 80.60 and that was a male to.\n\nin conclusion I think claim 1 is true.\n\n	1
I think this claim is partly true partly false because it has to be a certain temperture for a cryselis to form.	0
I think this claim is true because whether sea turtles lay there eggs in the sand and the different temperatures that effect in there eggs shell could change there formation of themselves. To turn into to a male or female. Also I notice that the temperatures stay in the eighties maybe  that also has something to do with it. Males usually in Suriname tend to stat around in under the 85's but females on the other hand stay above an 85 maybe that's a reason the come out male or female.\n	1
Most of the chrysalis temperatures are 60 degrees and over plus maybe the temperatures have something to do with their migration because the text did say that they preffered lukewarm temperature	1
I think it has to do with the turtle population.Because on top of the sand it was warm,But when you dig it gets colder because theirs no sun light but on the other hand when they get layed the ones more to the surface they have more light then others and it shows what is the temperature with is just the right to hatch in my option but the ones with less heat still might hatch that why i think it is partly true/partly false	0
I think that this is true because mostly the females are born in hotter sands but all the temputaures are close together which would make me conclude that it would be true. Climate change might over populate the sea turles because if more femals are born in hotter snads that there is going to be a lot more female sea turtles to lay there eggs. This could also impact the population in a different way. That way being there would be not enough males so they could not mate. So that would make the population drop.	1
I think its true because in colder weathers, monarch butterflies usually go inside where it warmer but when  monarch butterflies are in warmer weather they tend to go outside because it would be way warmer than the colder times.	0
I think that this is partly true because at  first it is a egg and then it goes into the caterpillar for a long time then it will go into the chrysalis then the last thing of its cycle is it goes into the butterfly and then it will go to its place to migrate but the place will not be to clod or it will not be to worm  it will  be just right for the butterfly to live in the winter time.	0
I think it doesn't mater	0

The Sea turtles, male or female, are born at a temperature of 80 to 90 degrees F.	0
I think it's partly true because it shows that inside they are mostly still chrysalis and outside its more of caterpillars	0

The temperature changes the gender because when they are first laid they sea turtles are are not formed. The sea turtles are really undentified	0

I believe that the temperature can maybe change if it is a male or female, but I don't really know.  Some of the results say record that there were 4 males or females in a row at the same place wich there temperatures would be different in different places, but they also show in some sections that they can be scattered (one female one day a male a different day). But on the other hand, a female lays there eggs all together in the same place under the sand so the temperature would be very close in the same hole and there are different genders in one hole.  So I think that it can be true or false.	0
i dont know	0
The temperatures are not that different. They are all in the high 50s/low 60s. The majority is the caterpillar even though the temperatures at least 1 degree apart. But then again a few degrees can make a difference depending on the study.	0
The graph provided with the investigation shows that commonly the higher temperature sands normally have hatching female turtles unlike hatching male turtles that do their thing in colder sands. Now in the graph, some male turtles hatch in warmer sands than female hatching turtles but not as often as the other way around. I still stick with my decision with true with my reasons conveniently said and the graph for evidence	1
Most of the monarchs are still caterpillars because it takes a long time to create a chrysalis,and since it takes long to make a chrysalis it is partly true.But if we did the same but with only chrysalis we will see that its just in the middle.	0

If the monarch butterfly goes through the stages fast then it's probably used to doing something fast and not having the patients to do stuff so that's probably one of it's habit	0
i think that this is partly true because the article said that the weather cant be too cold and cant be to warm. i think this could affect how they grow, if the monarch butterfly are in too warm of weather they could not grow properly. if they are in too clod of weather they could take longer to grow, or even worst die. i do agree that it can cause them to to grow. if monarch butterfly are in to warm or harsh weather it could cause the population to go down in stead of up. that is why i think climate can cause butterfly to not grow.	1
In the graph, you can see many of the females were found in Playa and many of the males in Suriname. The temperature for the females is mostly high ranging from 88-84. From this, we can make the claim that females spawn in warmer climates. As the males spawn in cooler areas.	1
the temperature does affect the life cycle of butterflies according to the evidence on the table.	0
i think it is true partly true and partly false because if they are in a really cold environment it probably would affect it when it comes out but it is partly not because when they are in the crystallites it can not affect them as much as when they come out	0
i believe that the sand can affect the gender some times because in the data that shows has the highest temperatures on top with the lowest on bottom and almost all of the high temps are female rather than male one of the highest temps is 88.08 and is female as well as 87.09, 86.97, 86.54, 86.26, those are the highest temps and they are all female the lowest temperature of the female in this test is 84.20 but most of the males is 83.31, 83.25, 82.45, 82.29, the highest of the males in this test is 85.19 quite low to the female turtles. I did say that this thought was partly true/partly false for these reasons	1
because in the hotter temperature the female eggs hatched	1
I think its wrong because there are similar temperatures and some die as a caterpillar and some die in a chrysalis. for example, there is one where it's 60.90 and it dies as a caterpillar then there's one where its 60.98 and it dies as a chrysalis.	0
I believe that the temperature of the monarchs habitats does not depend on the monarchs habitat temperature. The reason that it doesn't depend on the  temperature is because the results vary between inside and outside of the temperature of the chrysalis. One of the temperature for the chrysalis is 59.54 Fahrenheit  and another is 63.14 Fahrenheit that is a 4 degree difference. Also the colder one is outside and  the hotter one is inside. That's why i Believe that the temperature does not matter for a monarch caterpillar to turn into a chrysalis.	0
because the  evidence shows that the temperature is in the 80s so the sand has to be in the 80s to be hatched	0
I think this is fales because most of the higher the tepitures are still in the chrysallis stage	1
it shows that really no matter what temp it is that any male or female can hatch	0
I believe this claim is false. I believe it to be false because in the graph you can clearly see there is nearly an equivalent amount of male and female leatherback hatchlings. In addition, they are hatched in the same temperature range of about 80 to 85 Fahrenheit.	0
sample #7 is almost the exact same tep as #60	0
i dont now	0
\nthe sands temperature in the ocean shore affects if  it will be a boy or a girl who will hatch from the   turtles egg.	0
i think it is false because under the sand the temp is the same even when it is colder abouve ground\n	0
i thin that is true becaus that is wat the data said and thats the srcul of life for a buter fliy	0
in the lower tempature there are mainly males till 84.20 then it is mixed till 85.42 where the rest are al female	1
when it is the warmer climates the eggs are female and when the climates are below 85  they are male	1
I think it is false because if an egg is laying playa sand it can come out as a female or male because if you look at the chart and look at what gender is next to playa sand it will say either female or male, not just male, not not just female. Same to do with the Suriname sand.	0
The sand temperature affects whether leather-back eggs hatch as male or female because scientific research proves that when the eggs have been laid in warmer sand, the turtle is a female. When the egg is laid in cooler sand, the turtle is a male. Also, These turtles have been laid in different locations. So we know that in Playa the turtles don't tend to be female. That part is totally random. The Male and Female's were both scattered around Playa and Suriname.	1
is all way hot on a iland so they have t o udapt to the heat and there in the sand so the egg are cept cold	0
i think that if the temperature where to change the speed of the butterfly's growth then all the factors in the butterfly's life would change the speed of the butterfly growth and its life cycle i think maybe the winter could make them die so that why they go down to other areas such as Mexico and based on the data it says that the chrysalis was in 63 degree weather and that was the top degrees in this hole graph so that shows that the weather doesn't speed the life cycle of the monarch butterfly's.	0
I think this claim is true because if its cold the butterflies are gonna want to be in their Chrysalis. Like when you are cold you wouldn't want to be outside in the cold you want to be raped up in your blanket cause its warmer.	0
I thinks it is true because a Leather back  can have male or female. some male and female have temper in there body that makes it feel warm or cold.	0
I believe that the claim is partly true and partly false because in some parts it shows that maybe the cooler temperatures can change the affects is has on the life cycles but also the temperature is not really changing the affects because there may be a section where a cooler temperature shows that the life cycle is in the caterpillar form then is switches to a chrysalis but it can then switch back to the caterpillar making me believe it is partly true and partly false.	1
I think that it partially matters what temperature it is for a monarch butterfly to effect how fast it's life cycle goes because when i was looking at the data i noticed that if the temperature was over or at 60.48 then it was more likely to be in a chrysalis.	1
think that the tempter dose not matter as long as the butter file can survive.	0
The sand temperature affects whether leatherback eggs hatch as male or female because looking at the data, males have lower temperatures while the females have more.\n	1
because if it is cold the babies will die	0
When the temperature is higher its seems to male it slower because all of the chrysalis is 59 degrees or above and all of the caterpillars are 60 degrees and under. The chrysalis stage comes first and is all a higher temp than the caterpillars stage is after the chrysalis stage and is a lowe temp.	1
The temperatures of a monarch butterfly's can affect the life cycle because for example, the intense heat may interfere with butterfly's natural habitat and life cycle changes and can put heat on monarch butterfly's life cycle by shutting down their organs, or maybe slowing down the process of growing.	0
why i bileve that tempicher effects weather they are male or female because if you look on the cart most male eggs have lower tepicer and female has higher tempicher that is my reason why	1
i picked partly true and parly false because i feel like a butterfly starts asa catterpiller then grows to be a butterfly like other butterflys like ones we have in maine like the ones that come out in the summer and they have to have temperture thats not to hot or cold that is what i think\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\	0
females only hatch above 85 degrees and males hatch at 85 degrees and lower	1
i think that the statement was true because a butterfly cant be in the cold for as long as a caterpillar can because of the high winds and over the rain or snow coming down with all the hard pressure.	0
I think this claim is true because the butterfly can't be in the cold or high winds unlike a caterpillar that stays on the ground.	0
the leather back turtles gender is of the heat the females are mostly hotter than the males. the two that i pointed to were a boy and a girl the girls 5 hotter than the boy	1
I think the claim is false because there were similar tempters and it was out of order if it was male or female and in the wild scientists cant control the tempter of the beach so why wouldn't there be more of one type of gender	0
i said no because it says on the top temperature 85.80 and its a female and on the 2nd one down is says 85.04 and its a male	0
I say yes because it seems that the male are in the low 80s and that the male also and the female are hatching as female in the high 80s	1
when the caterpiler is in his chrysalis stage it is hoter but when it is in its normal stage it is ushiy less worm [NOTE: grayed out rows already coded in Feb13 file]	1

Because the temperature is higher.	0
I think it's partly true and partly false because there are some caterpillars that have not became a chrysalis in the same temperature as the caterpillars that have already became chrysalis.	0
butterfly's like the warmness but it does not help them grow does the warmness help us grow we like it like butterfly's it does not help us grow.	0
the monarch is a caterpillar when it is bellow 59 degrees and its a chrysalis when it is 59 degrees or higher.  But not always, #3 was a caterpillar while it was 59.36 degrees and #29 was still a cater pillar when it was 60.90 degrees.	1
yes because 50 50	0
i think it is true because it said on one that it is a caterpillar and it was 56.84 (F) but then when it was in a chsalar so the wather sangis all the time so the caterpillar is in all cinds of wether.	0
I think its true because in the important data its says the temperature can change if its a girl or boy	0
?	0
it shows that the higher temperature always gets female and every low temperature would be male	
Because you have to know the butterfly's temperature if you are going to learn about them\n	0
because when my uncle was in the coast gaured  had to practice scuba diving and when he did did they broat like a almost 100 year old turtle in i think i said i think to do somethng with it he never told me what he did with the turtle	0
Because some male temps are low that means that females are high temps. But some males are quite high in temps.	1
I think this is true because if it is super cold outside the butter fly will be very cold and might freeze to death.  But if it is to hot the butter fly might die of heat.	0
because some are a high temperature and the monarchs are still caterpillars but some of the low temperatures are chrysalises	1
I think its true because if you look at the data on the chart you can see that male turtles are hatched when the sand temperature is 85.04 and below and the females temperature is  is 85.04 and higher.	1
I dont know	0
True, because if the sand is cool then it is a male, but if the sand is hot then it is a female.	1
they wod be dead of the temprchor.\n	0
I think this claim is true because in Playa the temperature is 85.80 and the turtle is a Female and in Playa the temperature is 80.67 and the turtle is a Male.	0

The females are usually hotter.	1
because some times its colder than other times and its still the same part of the cycle\n	0
Most eggs don't hatch with warm weather but they also can hatch themselves.\n	0
because it starts from caterpillar to chrysalis, then it ends with a caterpillar not a butterfly.	0
Because when it's a girl the temperature is in the 80's and when its a boy the temperature is in the 80's too.	0
i think  it is false because they don't rush right throw  there life sycel	0
In Playa most of the females sand temperature is higher than the males sand temperature. Like number 1 Playa 85.80 was a female. then number 8 at Playa 80.67 was a male. So it must make a difference if the temperature of the sand is high or low because almost all of the lower ones are male and most of the higher ones are female.	1

All higher temperatures above 59.50 are in stage 3 or 4 because of how high the temperature is in there location. But just 6 of them are still in stage 2 though.I have thought about it and came up with this theory, they may have been born just went the temperature was warmer and they still are growing fast but just have not made the cut.	1
I can see that the Female has bigger numbers then the Males	1
becuse i feel like it is true and	0
The claim is false because I sorted it lowest to highest temperature and the caterpillars was yes, all in one group, but they kept going back 'n' forth. Caterpillars, chrysalis, then back to caterpillars. \nSo therefor the caterpillars will form into pupa at different rates in different temperature, however, it changes groups in the same temperature!\nFor instance, 59.36 is in the caterpillar bunch, but, the pupa is in 59.54.So maybe temperatures could support faster growth, however, due to the continuous changing i believe that this statement is also incorrect. That is why the statement is partly true, and partly false.\n	1
I think it is true because a turtle needs to feel comfortable when they are laying their eggs.	0
sometimes it might be harder to lay eggs and give birth in colder-weather because it might hurt	0
Cause the type of turtles only hatch as males	0
I think it is because if its cold the butterfly might freeze and if they are warm they will have a longer lifespan and they migrate so if the to some place warm and the tempature changes they might die	0
84.20 and up is allmost all female	1
Every chrysalis tested had a temperature between 59 degrees and 63 degrees. The majority of  the chrysalises were inside.\nEvery caterpillar tested was between 54 and 60 degrees. Most caterpillars were outside. the locations for both were very close between more inside or more outside. Overall, I think it is partially true is because it is true, but the difference in temperature ranges was very small and might not mean anything. Also, the location may or may not have made a difference.	1
if it is warm out it will change faster than if it is cold	1
The temperature for male eggs was between 80-86, which is lower than the 84-87 that the female eggs had. I believe that if the egg is warmer, females will hatch. If it's colder, males will hatch.	1
i'm not good with math\n	0
because if the temperature change  will efeck\nit and it will not think it is clam.	0
For the first 2 data reports, both "butterflies" were outside. 2\'s butterfly was outside in warmer weather, and was a chrysalis already. 1\'s butterfly\'s was in a cooler weather than 2 so warmer weather does speed up the life cycle of a butterfly.	1
I think That It's Partly true And Partly False Because When You Look At the chart it Kinda Changes The form By tempature But it Kinda Doesn't.	0
I think this is true because if you look at the temperatures \n84 degrees and up are all females and if you look at the male temperatures they are all 86 and under.	1
As you can see the claim is false one of the female leatherbacks are 82.45 and it was at suriname and a difrent leatherback was 86.97 and it was at suriname so it is false	0
i think that because they can both be man or femal	0
The data shows the caterpillars are turning into chrysalis at certain temperatures without supplying anymore info. How much did they eat? What did they eat? Where did they live? When did they eat? Were they sick? There's a lot more that we would need to know in order to tell. There are indoor caterpillars that turned in to chrysalis, but outdoor caterpillars, too. For all we know, the outdoor ones could be more productive out in the wild, and the indoor ones may just be fed and lazy.	0
I think its partly true and partly false Because, it depends where they are like if there  Africa i could be jest right or too hot or in Maine it could be to cold that's why they go away for the winter. They go the warmer climits when there climit is too cold. That's why I think its partly true and partly false.	0
The reason why is because heat can change how will it gose thought it's cycle because it can shevle up and it could die in the cold due to the tempture drop.	0
the temperature does not seem to affect the butterfly's life cycle.	0
I think it is true because in the data the lower temperature the more males and the higher temperature the more females.	1
If you look at the temperatures from lowest to highest, you see that all the lowest temperatures say caterpillar and the higher temperatures say chrysalis. This shows that the temperature of the habitat affects how quickly monarch butterfly's life cycle stages change.	1
I don't think that the temperature affects there gender because they were already made in the costumier of the turtle. So if I was in my moms costumier and it was hot I don't think that would affect my gender. But this is a hole different animal. But its not able to switch its gender.\nA mom cant just say i want a girl. that's not possible.	0
Most of the male eggs are hatched in cooler weather, however most of the female eggs are in a little bit warmer weather	1
i think it is true because if there cocoon is frozen then they can't be changing and there stages of becoming a butterfly.That's why i think the temperature matters in a butterfly's habitat.	0
it does not madder about the weather. It just madders what the turtle gave birth to in the eggs.	0
Lots of the turtles that were raised in a cooler environment were males. A piece of evidence is from 80.60 to 83.85 are all males. The females are manly in the group with higher temperature. For example from 85.42 to 88.08 are all females.	1
Becuase if its cold the monarch will die becuse it does not have much fat on it so if will freeze to death	0
if you look at 1,2,and 3 the first is female and the temperature is at 85.80 and then the second one is male the temperature for that one is 85.04 but if you look at the third its female but the temperature is 84.77 which is colder than the males	0
I think it is partly true and partly false because most of the sand that was 85 or higher were females, and most of the sand that 85 or lower were males. It isn't like this through the whole thing.	1
because the male turtles have to stay safe and if we are being honest i don't remember the question	0
sometimes it did turn into a chrysalis, and sometimes it didn't. Iv'e heard that it depends how much food it has.	0
If your looking at the chart, the females temperature is much higher than the males but, some of the temperatures are the same for both the genders. Thats why I think its partly true.	1
when it was cold outside they were mostly still caterpillars. I also saw that some of them were inside witch I think has effected how they grew to be butterflies because it was warmer inside then outside some days,  I think that may of effected how they grew.	1
When you sort the data from low to high,you can clearly see that the claim is partly true. On the lower side of the chart, it is only male but in the middle some of the temps. Run up to 85.19 dagress. Which was uncommen for the sex. Wich is why only part of the claim is true.	1
because when in the higher temperatures the insect is mostly in the caterpillar stage and when it's in the lower temp they're mostly in the chrysalis stage but in some parts of the table that is not true.	1
Sea turtles are kinda the same as people. When they are born the heat doesn't change the gender. For ex: Sample number 3 and 16 They both have 84 as there temperature but one is female and one is male. It depends on if the father gave that egg the X or Y in the chromosomes.	0
I think this is false because they are all different temperatures and one of the males temperature is 84.98 and a females is 84.20 so those are almost the same temperature so it does not matter.	0
The temperature of the monarch butterfly's habitat can kind of affect how fast they change if the conditions are to hot they might form faster than if the conditions were cooler. the butterfly's can sometimes be in the sand and if they are lower in the sand they wont get as hot but  the higher up they are in the sand the hotter they will get and might form faster. if they are i sand they can change all kinds of speeds but it can all depends on where they are in the sand.	1
I said what I said because of males where more cornily born in colder places	1
because if its to cold it might freeze, killing the butterfly, and if its to warm or hot it could die of exhaustion or it could over-heat causing the stages of a butterfly to slow down.	0
I think its false because if stage 3 froze than i will take more time to unfreeze.	0
The temperature of the sand shouldn't affect the eggs because when you look at your data table you can see there is no clear pattern for the temperatures to prove that there is a way for the temperature to affect whether leatherback eggs are hatch as male or female.	0
higher the tempeature the more females hatched	1
i think its true because the temperature affects whether leatherback eggs hack then they will die	0
I think it is false because the turtle born in Playa for example is a female that was born at a temperature of 85.80 degrees Fahrenheit and one of the males born in Playa is 84.98. There is also males, and females born in Suriname that are almost exactly the same temperature when they were born. In conclusion that is why i think that The sand temperature doesn't affect whether leatherback eggs hatch as a male or female.   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\np	0
I think it is true because if it is cold it is harder for them to turn into a butterfly because it is so cold outside. Another example is if it is really hot outside then it would be hard for the crystal to change because it is so hot.	0
all the females are at a higher tem like 85 butt the males are lower like 80 but some males are at 85 too and some females are as low as 84	1
a male was born i 86.54 temp	0
The thing I just read said that the eggs can change but nothing about weather effects the turtle eggs.	0
I think this is true because the tempertature can effect how the butterfly can grow, also how fast it grows.	0
because some eggs need to be incubated and stuff and some dot so maybe the sand can cause it to not you hatch it can take longer	0
Because it takes time for it to go through the stages. The temperature could change it maybe a little bit but not a lot for it to change how quick the stages go by.	0
Different butterflies are at different stages and the temperature  has nothing to do with how fast the butterfly goes through the stages of its life.	0
I think its only Party True / Partly False. I think this because if you look at the data you will see mainly in one locations its true about the claim but once you look at both you see that it's its not all true. Because for example #28 and #2 Work then if you look at another pair such as #22 and #26 it doesn't work in the slightest if you compare with the first example.	0
if the sand is hot it will eafeck the eggs	0
Claim: My claim is that the tempeture of the sea turtles eggs doesnt affect the gender. \nEvidence: In the data it doesn't neccarsily show weather or not the it makes a different of the gender on the types of sea turtles. For example the lowest tempeture. The highest temperture is 88.8 which is a female. The lowest temperture is 80.60 which is a male. Also in the data all the tempertures are mixed around it doesnt show anything like females are always hotter and males are colder and vice versa.\nReasoning: That is the reasoning why i do not think that the tempeture of the egg in the sand does not impact the gender of the sea turtle.	0
The temperature was higher for females.	1
I think it is true because if this butterfly went some where really cold then i think it would affect how quickly it goes through their stages.	0
it goes up and down in the data.	0
I think its partly true and partly false because some of the male and females have almost the same exact temperature and some of them have lower or higher temperatures so it can be either gender depending on the coldness or the warmth of the sand or the eggs.	0
My claim is that the temperature that a chrysalis is in depends on how fast it grows into an adult because, if the temperature is 50 that is not normal for a butterfly to grow in the average temperature is around 60 degrees Fahrenheit. So if it was 50 degrees it would be below what they are used to so it would grow slower.	1
i think is is true because the lowest for males to spawn is 80.60 temp and the lowest for females is 84.20 temp so the hotter the sand it will be a female the colder the sand is it going to be a male and that's why the sand temperature affects if it's a male or female	1
I think the sand temperature does affect whether the turtle is male or female according to the data chart any temperature under 85 degrees the egg hatches and it's a male any temperature above 85 when the egg hatches it's a female.	1
it is the same speed going throthe life sicel.	0
I think this claim is partly true because most of the the ones in the 60's are chrysalises and most of the 50's are not	1
I think that it is partially true because it shows that the warmer the temperature the faster it will grow but, I believe this only goes for when the caterpillar is outside because it seems that when a caterpillar is inside it doesn't grow as quickly because  it's not in it's natural habitat.	1
because there all in the 80 to 85 temperature so it cant be because of the temperature. Some of them are almost the same temperatures but there different genders.\n	0
I think this claim is true because when the monarch butterfly was outside and the temperature was at 56.84 it was only a caterpillar. But when a different monarch butterfly was also outside at a temperature of 59.54, it was already  in a chrysalis.	1
I think that  it is partly Fales cuz it lakes a long time to              \nbecome a butterfly..	0
When the sand temperature is hotter the eggs hatch as female, and when the sand is cooler the eggs hatch as male. For example, some of the male egg temperature were, 80.60, 82.45, and 83.25. But then some of the female temperatures were, 87.09, 88.08 and 86.54, so there is a big difference in those temperatures which means that the eggs hatch as female when the sand is hotter, and the eggs hatch as male when the sand is cooler.	1
I think that the tempature can affect how fast the butterfly goes through it's life cycles because you don't want the temperature to be too hot or too cold, so I think that the outside was perfect tempature because if it was too hot the butterfly would probably not be able to grow as fast but you would want kind of hot so a little hotter then warm. You don't really want it to be that cold for a butterfly because then it won't grow fast you barely want any cold.	0
because the numbers jump all over the place from high to low.So it seems like it dosent matter what tempature it is	0
We believe the temperature of the sand does contribute to male or female eggs.  Male's were primarily hatched in the low 80's to 83 range.  Females were primarily hatched in the 85 - 88 range.	1
The claim is false because one Monarch it grew up at 59.54 degrees, and it is in the 3rd stage of growing which is the chrysalis. While a Monarch who grew up in warmer temps at 63.14 degrees is at the same step in there life cycle the chrysalis. And that is why this claim is false	0
The reason why is because the 8th sample was at Playa it was 80.67 degrees and it was a male and the 9th sample it was at the same place and the temperature was 84.20 and it was a female. So the warmer it is it is a female the colder it is it is a male. Every temperature that is over 84 degrees is a female every temperature that is under 84 degrees is a male.\n	1
I think true because if a monarch butterfly's habitat is cold then it  will not be able to transfer throw out all of the other stages in its life cycle, but if a monarch butterfly's habitat is warm then it will be able to transfer throw the stages. Just like if a human goes out side in the cold then the fluids inside of your body will not stay warm, but if you are inside and it is warm inside then the fluids in your body will keep running faster throw out your body.	1
I believe that the female are born in the higher temperature than the males. The numbers on the board for females the highest is 87.09 for for the temp, but for the boys it's like 83.62 for the temp.	1
I think its false because male and female turtles were being born in 85 degrees.The same goes for 84 degrees.	0
hi my name is ................	0
all of the chrysalis are 60 or above and all of the caterpillar are below 59	1
because It's mostly the same temperature.	0
because sea turtles are dieing we got to say those sea turtles	0
I believe that the sand temperature affects whether the leather back eggs hatch as a fem. or male.Because in the article it said that scientist sometimes collect the eggs and control the temp. and then check if they are a fem. or male.	0
Yes this is true because I sorted the temps from low to high, and on average the lower temps were all male hatchlings. and the high temps were all female, so yes there is a corallation between sand temperature and the the gender of the eggs of leatherback turtles.	1
i don"t know	
i choose no because all sands are the same	
because it will still be in the 50 or 60 degrees if it is outside or inide	0
It's True because it is the same thing but their are a little diference. They almost have the same patterns.	0
its false because we don't have enough information.	0
No because there are all diffrent types of temetures and they are both female and male so this claim is false. They all are 80 degres or over.	0
The lower temperature they are in the caterpillar stage and in the higher temperature they are in a chrysalis stage.	1
dot no\n	0
I don't think it really matters were they are born or what temp it is they will be any gender really think suriname has more boys than girl and playa has more girls than boys.	0
I think the terteles are lether back becuse there are diferet to other  tipes of anamules	0
The sand temperature does not hove anything to do with if the leatherback being male or female.\n\n	0
it taks abowt a yere	0
well most females in the data are born in 85.50 degrees  or more and most males are born below 85.50 degrees. all but 2 females are bore in less 80.50 degrees. and there not 1 male is born in more that 80.50. so its not exactly true but it is party true	1
if its to cold it will freeze to death and if its to warm its perfect temp for it to live	0
Normaly when the temp is in the 60's they usually are in their chrysalis period of transformation. But one of the chrysalis periods is in the 50 to 59 degree range.	1
there are more female in the higher temp and the males are in the lower temp and they kind of mix in the middle	1
when the temperature is lower most of the butterflys are still caterpillers and when the temperature is higher most of the butterflys are chrysalis	1
I think this is true because if you read 20 you can see why I think it is the right answer.	0
Sample 1 & Sample 2 were about the same temp but were Male and Female.\n\nBut in Sample 23 & 24 the temp was 4 degress different,but were also Male and Female.	0
i think it is  true because in this story it said it was faster when it was warm and not when it was cold\n	1
i think its partly true and partly false because number 1 and  2 are both 85 degrees and one is male and ones female but numbers 19 and 20 is a big different 19 is 80 degrees and its a male and 20 is 86 degrees and a female	1
If you look at the data you will see the data I highlighted their is a Temperature the same and they are Male and Female.	0
It's not about the sand tempature it's about if their genes are stronger and their genes dertermine what gender they are.	0
If a monarch butter was in a cold tempertured area it would take longer because its to cold but if it was really warm the proces would go quicker.	1
It's false because if you look at the data, there are still some caterpillars that have the same temperature as the ones in the chrysalis's. That means they are in the same temperature as the ones who are growing up faster.	0
the go thro stoages and the wintr thay are thry millen miols from thay nachrol habtat	0
I think when the caterpillar is outside it will get very warm and when the caterpillar is inside it will cool off.	0
I think it is true because if it hurting the eggs then it will start to hurt the baby turtel inside and that means there might not be anymore turtels after this!	0
there wore more boys than girls but  they were pretty close the same amount so that's why I said it was partly true and partly false	0
because the butterfly has to go places	0
As I quickly looked through the location, and went onto temperature where I looked and saw that mainly the monarch butterfly does turn into the chrysalis quicker at hotter temperatures whether inside or outside.	1
The caterpillars all went into their pupas when the temperature was 59 degrees (F) or higher.	1
when the temature became hotter and more dense the buterfly started going through the cycles of their transformation	1
because the report showd that the tempiture dosent realy matter	0
because the tempature is the same all the time or in the same range or temp.	0
because  the sand in the summer id most of the time on the top of the sand is hot but on the bottom, it is cool not super cold then  \n   \n? do they lay eggs in the winter	0
After studying the data I conclude that the sea turtles who were born when the sand temperatures were 84 degrees primarily turned out as females. But when the temperatures were 83.99 degrees and below the sea turtle were males.	1
Because it shows inside and outside and two are both caterpillars but then also one is a chrysalis. That is the same tempachure so kinda true kinda false	0
It is false because it never said anything about the temperature.  And it didn't say anything really about the male and female.	
It is false because it never said anything about the temperature.  And it didn't say anything really about the male and female.	
it's partly true and partly false because maybe the sand temperature does affect whether leatherback eggs to hatch as male or female but it could be false because it depends on the gender who knows if the sand temperature affects the animal's gender	
it's partly true and partly false because maybe the sand temperature does affect whether leatherback eggs to hatch as male or female but it could be false because it depends on the gender who knows if the sand temperature affects the animal's gender	
when outside it  chrysalis's faster and it's warmer outside	1
Some males where  born in hot tempture same as females. It goes back and forth to say the heat affects the gender, if you say that  the hotter sand has females you would probly wrong  next time some males where born in high tempture  thats why its probly false.	1
because all female turtles lay their eggs on the beach and then she leaves them	0
because for some reason the heat makes the gender different and the turtles know this so they place their eggs in different places accordingly.	0
wel the data proves the fact true in the evidence because the higher temp the life cycle proceeded quicker	1
In the chart to the right in the outside with the crysalis is almost the exact same outiside with a catipillar	0
if the caterpillar is in the cold weather wean it is in a chrysalis it would slow it down the save its energy.	0
as the temprature ranged from 57-62 the catarrpillars turned into stage 3 crysiless depending on the location this could be caused by humidity outside or inside but as it got warmer they changed mostly on the warmer side inside and a little cooler outside again probably from humidity	1
It was warm and it grew and it was cold and it grew the same time.	0
because most of the time there are male and female sometimes there are just female and sometimes the a just males because male need to be colder to the ground or the won't be a male they will then be a female. female need to be warmer than the males if there to cold they will most likely to be a male	1
i think its false because it said that they hatch in the sand and go find safety in the sea they don't  say anything about having a special temature.	0
because at temperatures higher than 60 the caterpiller would be in a chrysalis and any lower it was still a caterpiller.	1
it keeps the eggs warm\n	0
maybe it is because of  partly true/ partly False	0
sometimes the female leatherbacks are born around 84 degrees to 87 degrees.\n	1
I think it is not eftine becaues it do not say that it is	0
Usually, a caterpillar needs its time to hatch into a butterfly. That's why\nthey try to find the best place in a warm and slightly cold place like California and Mexico. If you don't know. On Day 11 the Chrysalis did not hatch faster or slower. It usually stays outside more than inside	0
I think it is true because different habitats can have an effect on stuff like the food there. not the right food can affect its life stages life, for example, it could be late on becoming a butterfly or like it could be a caterpillar for longer than it should	0
It says the sand temperature affects whether leatherback eggs hatch as male or female, but scientists figure out when they hatched.	0
because it said it in the reading	0
I think its partly true/ partly false because in some parts it's colder than the warm temperature and it still said chrysalis.	1
I think that the temperature efaces the cycle cus of the  temp difference of the caterpillar and the chrysalis	0
All of the facts that were included in this text had great details. I think temperature does effect how fast the monarchs go through their life cycle. I think this because if they get to cold when they are in their chrysalis they can freeze on the inside and not grow. Also, if it is too hot for the caterpillar in it's chrysalis it would probably kill them and cause them to not grow anymore.	0
Partly false because I assorted the data table by temperature and some temperatures were the same but they had a different gender. Partly true because from 80-84 they were mostly only male turtles and just a few female turtles. Through 85-88 there was only female turtles.	0
After 11 days there were more chrysalises when it was warmer and more caterpillars as it got colder. So warmer temps make the monarch butterfly's life cycle go faster.	1
I think the sand temperature affects whether leatherback eggs hatch as a male or a female. I think that because on the data the warmest sand had mostly females and the cooler the sand got the more males there was. The warmest sand a male was hatched in was 85.19. The coolest a female egg hatched was 84.20. That is why sand temperature affects whether leatherback eggs are female or male.	1
most shows that the tep is difrent but they still grow the samw	0
I think that the  sand tempechure WONT change wether  a sea tuttle haches a boy or girl. Becauls i looked at the data tabelle and saw that mostly  regardles of the  temechure ita an even chance.	0
I think sand temperature affects leatherbacks so they hatch as male or female. Temperature from as low as 84.20 to as hi as 88.08. Males are as low as 80.60 and as hi as 85.19.	
I think sand temperature affects leatherbacks so they hatch as male or female. Temperature from as low as 84.20 to as hi as 88.08. Males are as low as 80.60 and as hi as 85.19.	
I think it's true because, I think that when it's hot the chrysalis is more likly to be wanting to get out of the chrysalis. The butter fly could also be wanting to dry it's wings on the sun ( because it's hot.)	0
If you put the temperature from lowest to highest and look at the male/  female collem, the low temperature is female, and the male is in the high temperature.	0
I think the temperature affects the monarch butterfly because when i changed the temperature to highest to lowest i saw that in the 60s i saw that they were all mostly chrysalis and when the the temperature is lower they are caterpiler.

some of the chrysalis are at the 56 degree mark but most of them are from 60 to	
some caterpiller's and chrysalis live in the same location and some are growing faster than others	0
I looked at the chart and saw a female and male turtle that live in different places but same temputure	0
I think the claim is true because the graph shows that the highest temperature shows that the catupiler is in its chrysalis the coldest temperature the butterfly was still a catipiller.	1
the males are at the bottom and some in the middle, the females are at the top there are three in the middle. Also it said in the beginning that the temperature determines if they are male or female.	1
When I was looking at the evidince, I noticed that all of the males were in sand of the temperature 85.19, and lower. all of the females were born at the temperature of 84.20 and higher. So to conclude the males are born at colder temperatures, and the females were born at slightly warmer temperatures.	1
I found that the butterflies grow more in warmer weather.   The butterflies in 54 degrees were still in the caterpillar stage.  But in the 62 degree range they were in the chrysalis stage.  That shows they grew more.	1
The data shows that in higher temperatures females are normally hatched.  In lower temperatures male are normally hatched.	1
sample ones temp is 56.84 and is a catapiller.sample twos temp is 59.54 and is a christallis.	
sample ones temp is 56.84 and is a catapiller.sample twos temp is 59.54 and is a christallis.	
I know the temperature of the monarch butterfly's habitat affects how quickly it goes through its life cycle stages is because when I sort the data by cold to hot and most of the hot temperature was the chrysalis meaning they do better in hot places	1
I think this is false because the temperatures are around the same number in the 80's.	1
I am seeing that the life cycle IS affected by the temp. of their habitat.\nSome evidence that my claim is true is that 60 Degrees *f is when they start turning in to caterpillers but over 60 is chryalises.	1
One reason why I think that is partly true partly false is if that were true then either 1 or 25 would NOT be the same gender as they are because number 1 (85.80) is only .61 hotter than 25 (85.19). I think it is partly true to because the the data shows Females average 85 and a half maybe more and also shows the Males average 84 and a half so that is why I think that it is partly true and partly false.	1
so on my chart i changed it to temp and it shows the colder it is the more likely to become a Caterpillar faster then the hotter places in the hotter places they are still in there chrysalis so it does affect how fast it goes through the life cycle and if i were a butterfly i would want to live in a colder place because i'm impatient.	0
the importent info sayes the tempecher efects the gender.  its right because with my evedence it effects the turtles by gender.it also sayes that the temp efects the turtules in the story.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ns	0
I think this claim is false because if you see on the data when monarch butterfly's  are inside they can be a caterpillar or a chrysalis. But on the outside it shows that it can be the same as the indoor. Also as you can see lower temperatures and higher temperatures can both be caterpillars or chrysalis's. So I don't believe the temperature affects them or the habitat.	1
I think this claim is partly true and partly false. I think this because if you look at the males most of them have lower temperatures than the females. Most males are 85 to 80 for their temperatures. As you see most females are 85 and up. But some males are higher than 85 and some females are lower than 85. But as you see most females are higher than 85 and most males are lower than 85.	1
Well, when I sorted the data by temperature lowest to highest, I looked at the life cycle stages and first there were a chunk of caterpillar  and then chrysalis  then more caterpillars back and fourth. I think that if the claim was true then all the caterpillars would be together and all the chrysalis would be together.	1
The highest temparatures of sand are normally when females are born. The lowest tempatures are mostly male.	1
the weather makes the monarch slow done if it is to cold out they stay as caterpillars and when it is hot they grow up faster.\n They grow faster if they eat more.\nthey grow slow if it is 61 to 54 farinhite\nmost of theyse are still caterpillars because it is still cold	1
I see that the males mostly hatch in a little colder sand. I also see that the females are mostly born in sand that is a little bit warmer then the males. I think that the fact is partly true because that is not true for some of the turtles.	1
I think it is partly true party false. If you look at the claim it is (the sand temperature affects weather leatherback eggs hatch as male or female.) Then look at the chart male temperature is from 85.19 to 80.60. Then look at female the temperature is from 88.8 to 84.20 so to me it looks like that if there is a higher temperature then there is a female and a lower temperature for a male. But I only think it is partly true partly false because the temperatures 84 and 85 are both in range for them both.	1
I think that it is true because when the temperature is higher there are mostly chrysalis and when it is colder there are more caterpilers.	1
I think it is true because a lot of the low temperatures are males and high is mostly female.	1
I think this claim is true because the caterpillars that were in warmer places have already gone to chrysalis stage. where as the other ones are still in caterpillar stage.	1
I believe that the sand temperature affects whether leatherback eggs hatch as male or female and here's why. because the lower 80s are mostly male the middle temp. 80s are a good mix, and the high 80s are mostly female.	1
If you look at the table you will see that if it is most likely to be warm the turtle will be a female. Because I looked at all of the temperature and the temp is high if it is a female. If the temperature is on the cooler side then that means that the turtle will be a male. All of the temperatures that show males have a lower temperature than the females. And females have a higher temperature than the males. So I think when it is warmer it will be a female and when it is cooler it will be a male.	
If you look at the table you will see that if it is most likely to be warm the turtle will be a female. Because I looked at all of the temperature and the temp is high if it is a female. If the temperature is on the cooler side then that means that the turtle will be a male. All of the temperatures that show males have a lower temperature than the females. And females have a higher temperature than the males. So I think when it is warmer it will be a female and when it is cooler it will be a male.	
i think this claim is true because when the temperature  is warmer most of the butterflies stay inside. When, the temperature is colder most of them stay outside to make there chrysalis.	1
I think it is true because male eggs like the sand cooler then female eggs like the sand .The male eggs like 80 to 85 degrees and female like it 84 to 88 degrees.	1
I think the claim is true because in the information I recently got almost all the lowest are outside of the chrysalis and some off the highest are still inside of the chrysalis so my point is that the higher the temperature the longer your in the chrysalis.	1
I think that claim 1 is true because when the sand gets hot its most likely that a female will hatch. So when it gets colder some of the males will be born so what I am saying is whenever the sand gets hot a female comes out. Whenever the sand is cold and warm a male will come out.	1
I think this claim is true because, when I organized the data by temperature, I saw some patterns. First, when the eggs were in the 54 - 59.36 degree range, they were all caterpillars. Second, when the eggs were in the 59.37 - 60.90 degree range, they were a mixture of caterpillars and chrysalises. Lastly, when the eggs were in the 60.91 - 64 degree range, they were all chrysalises. That is why I think the claim is true. The temperature of a monarch butterfly's habitat does affect how quickly it goes through its life cycle stages.	1
I think it's partly true/partly false because from the data outside is kind of warmer then inside and in the higher tempertures the monarchs are already at the chrysalis stage. In the article it said that monarchs move to warmer places in the winter. Places that are not to cold and not to warm. But I also think it is partly false too because looking at the data some monarchs that are inside are in chrysalis.	1
The higher temperature are mostly female and the lower temperature are mostly male. I said partly true partly false because some male sea turtles are high temperatures and some female sea turtles are in the lower temperatures.	1
I think it is partly true partly false, its partly true because i realize that female baby turtles are born with higher tempatures and males are born with lower tempatures, and I can understand that. But I also think its partly false because number 2 (male) has 85.04, and number 28 (female) has a tempature in the range of 84, so does number 3 and number 9. Im a little confused of what this means and I think that if females are born in that area, the should be males.

Because most of the lower temps. are caterpillars and most of the higher temps. are chrysalis.	1
The lower the temperature is, the slower the life cycle goes.	1
The higher the temperature is the higher the chance it's going to be a female. The lower the temperature is the higher  chance it has to be a Male leatherback.	1
I think the first claim is partly right and partly wrong because if you look at the data close enough you will see that the highest temperature is 63.14 and the life cycle stage is a chrysalis and as the temperature goes down you see that the life cycle stage has changed into a caterpillar so the life cycle of stage of the butterflies is taking a bit longer.	0
its partly true because sea turtles do lay there eggs in the sand its partly false because the sand temperature does not help the eggs hatch into a boy or a girl	0
it does affect how quickly it goes through the life cycle \nbecause there are more chrysalis in the warmer weather so the colder weather makes it harder for them to go through life cycle stages.	1
The reason why I think it is false is because it the data there is about the same amount of male and female turtles in each location. I also think this because in the data there is not much proof that the temperature affects the gender of the turtle.	1
Most of the chrysalis's are in warmer temps and most of the caterpillars are in cooler temps however, there are a noticeable amount of caterpillars in with  the chrysalis's.	1
I think that wen it gets hoter it seams that the speasheas gros faster as you see in the graf.	1
I think that wen the sand is wormer the lether back trtals are more likly to be feamael becas the chart shows that in wormer temichers the tertals are feamale	1
up high has mostly chrysalis and down below is all catapilar starting at sample number 3, inside, 59.36 degrees. however there are a few catapilars up above too.	1
according to the chart higher temperatures seem to have female eggs and lower the temperatures seem to have more male. but in the middle of the chart mae and female are a little mixed up.	1
I think it is partly true/ partly false. I think this  if you look at the data, it will go back and fourth between chrysalis and caterpillar. Right in the middle of the data it goes back and fourth. there will sometimes be a caterpillar in the beginning. I believe that it could help to study the location of the butter fly. and if it is inside or outside a building/structure.	0
I know the claim is partly true and partly false. I know this because The hot sand produces females and cold sand produces male turtles. the partly part is because in the middle of the graph, it's a mix of male, and female babies. I sorted it this way because the question was on the temperature of sand.	0
I think this is partly true and partly false because, when I sorted the data lowest temperature to highest, the lowest temperatures had mostly caterpillars. When I looked at the higher temperatures it had mostly chrysalises.There were still a few caterpillars in the high temperatures so I think this fact is partly true,partly false	0
when i sorted the temperatures from lowest to highest it the males and females were mixed up. so i think that this would be partly true partly false	0
The top of the Life Cycle Stage List where it is colder has all caterpillars and at the bottem of the list where it is hotter has a lot of chrysalis's \n\nI think that when it is warmer they go threw their stages faster and when it is colder they go threw their stages slower	1
The table shows that lower temperatures are males and higher temperatures are female	1
In the data shown in the picture it looks like the lower the temperature the slower the life cycle is.The data also shows the higher the temperature the faster the life cycle is.	1
I think this is partly true and partly false because their is one section where the graph doesn't support the claim of sand temperature effecting the gender. The graph also shows that the claim cant be fully false.	1
of you look at sort by Temperature high to low you will find that if it 85 degreas and up it will be a female and 84 degreas and lower is mail.	
of you look at sort by Temperature high to low you will find that if it 85 degreas and up it will be a female and 84 degreas and lower is mail.	
If you look at number 26 the temperature is 63.14 and the butterfly is in its chrysalis but if you look at number 29 the butterfly is a caterpillar	0
3 males were born in very hot sand and 2 females were born in cold\nsand	0
I think that this is false because when you are a caterpillar you are not inside of you egg or chrysalis. And it says that when the caterpillar is in their chrysalis then are outside of their chrysalis. So like they are not even in it.	0
I think that it may be true because the highest temperature was a female and the lowest temperatures were all male. But i'm not positive all of the way because when the temperature got to around 84 degrees, it switched into like a pattern of male female male female female and then went onto the rest of the temps witch were only male.	0
I think its true because males and females are different just like a girl and boys are different and turtles need the right temperature to have baby turtles yes playa and suriname is a place that I dont know it is very warm 80 degres of the sand is very warm for baby turtles baby turtles need the same temperature same of the two places have different temps turtles are babys the sand might be too hot or too cold turtles need the right place the also need the weather to be warm to go in the cold water because the water will be even more cold if there is not sun the water will be warm	0
Because it is true	0
When the temperature is higher the butterfly is turning into a chrysalis and soon the chrysalis is turning into a monarch butterfly.	1
because I said so	0
i think that this is false because when the temptures are higher it take longer and most people would think that it would go faster because there is more food.	0
I think this question is true because when the temperatures are getting warmer there are lots of chrysalis'. But when it is a little colder out there are mostly caterpillars.	1
i think that it is incstre but false\n	0
it can tack longer for some butterfly's to go in to a chrysalis, then others.	0
\n      \n\n\n           *14/28 are female's in this graph.\n            \n            *14/28 are male's in this graph.\n      \n\n                  which mean's...it is a 50/50   \n                  chance it is a female and \n                  50/50 chance it is a male. \n\n\n          by suraiea smith	0
i think this because everything is different and if it is true when its inside and 59 above it does seem a little true.	0
I think that the temperature affects the turtle eggs hatching male or female because as you can see on my graph, most of the lower temperatures are male, and the higher temperatures are female.	1
it is arowed the same temp	0
I think this claim is true because when the temperature rises, there seem to be more females. between 84.20-85.19 it is kinda scattered but in general, it seems like the lower the temp. the more males, but the higher the temp. the more females. since this claim doesn't go into many specifics, I think we could say yes, the sand temperature affects the gender of the turtles.	1
I think that it's false, because there most likely  be a way for the sand does the turtles gender's.	0
It is true because the temp. is just like the other female temp. so that is why I think it is true.	0
if it was cold it probably not hatch	0
so the temp. helps but not to hot	0
I think this because if you look at the graph, then you can see that the average of female turtles are born in the warmer temperatures and the male turtles are born in the more cold temperatures.	1
how it migerates it changes treaw the wind	0
because they just don't just lay girl turtle	0
if its cold or if its a bigger egg it will hatch more slow if its a bigger or more cold cattipiler will stay in to keep worm	0
there are no other resons	0
it dose not mater.	0
Beacues the heat does not damage it but it could	0
because the sometimes they will momentarily leave the area	0
Look at 1968, 83.75 degrees, and then look at 2016, 85.57 degrees the temperature goes higher not lower.	1
