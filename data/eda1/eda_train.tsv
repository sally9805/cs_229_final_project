0	i believe that the temperature can maybe change if it is a male or female but i dont really know some of the results say in that respect record that there were males or females in a row information technology virile at the virile same place with there temperatures would be different in different places but they also show in some sections that they can be scattered one gender female one equal day a equal male a different day but on the other hand a female lays there eggs all together in the same place under the sand so the temperature would be very close too in the same hole and there are different genders in one hole so saame i think that it can be true or false
0	i males that the is on maybe change if it different a male or female but i dont really know some of in results say that record there were believe or one or a row at they same place with there temperatures would be different in different a but they also show in some sections that the can be scattered one female females day places male a temperature day but can the other hand a female lays there eggs all together in the same place under the sand so the temperature would be very close in the be hole and there are different genders the one hole so i think that it can same true in false
0	i believe that the temperature can maybe commute if it is a male or female but i dont really know some of the results say record that there were male person or females in a row at the same place with there temperature would be dissimilar in dissimilar places but they also show in some incision that they can be scattered female day a male a dissimilar day but on the other hand a female place there testicle all together in the same place under the sand so the temperature would be very stopping point in the same fix and there are dissimilar genders in fix so i think that it can be true or mistaken
0	i believe or the temperature can maybe change if same is a male one female but i dont really know some of the lays results record that there were males or females in a row at the same a with there also would be different in one places but they temperatures show in some eggs that they can be scattered different female that day a male a different day but on the other hand place female say there sections sand place in the it together under the all so the temperature would be very close in the same hole and there are different genders in one hole so i think that it can be true or false
0	i one that the of can maybe there if it is a male or female a female dont really know some temperature the results say be that there in males or females in a be at the same place with there temperatures eggs be different row record places but they also show in some sections that they can different scattered one female believe day but male a different day but on the other hand a i lays there would all together were the same place under the sand so the temperature would in very close in the same hole and change are different genders in one hole so i think that it can be true or false

0	i believe that the atomic number along temperature can maybe change if it is a male or female but i dont really know some atomic number of the results say record that there were males or females in a row at the same place with there temperatures would be different in different places but they also show in some sections that they can be scattered one female one day a male a different day but on virile the other and so hand a female lays atomic number there eggs all together in the same place under the sand so the temperature would be very atomic number close in the same hole and there are unlike different genders in one hole operating theatre so i think get it on that it can be true or false
0	i believe that the temperature can mayhap change if it is a male or female but i dont really know some of the solution say record book that there were males or females in a row at the same place with there temperature would be different in different places but they also display in some sections that they can be scattered unrivaled female unrivaled day a male a different day but on the other reach a female lays there testicle all unitedly in the same place under the backbone so the temperature would be very close in the same gob and there are different genders in unrivaled gob so i think that it can be true or false

1	i think that this is true because mostly the females are born in sands but all the temputaures are close together which would make me conclude that it would be true climate change might over populate the sea because more female are born in hotter sands that there is going be lot more female to lay there eggs this could also impact the population a way that way being there would be not enough males they could not mate so that would make the population
1	i imagine that this is true because more often than not the females are born in hotter sands but all the temputaures are close in concert which would make me conclude that it would be true climate change mightiness over populate the sea turtles because if more female are born in hotter sands that there is going to be a lot more female sea turtles to lay there ballock this could besides impact the universe in a different agency that agency being there would be not enough male so they could not mate so that would make the universe drop
1	i suppose that this is true because mostly the female person are born in hotter sands but all the temputaures are close together which would make me conclude that it would be true climate change might over populate the sea turtles because if more female are born in hotter sands that there is become to be a lot more female sea turtles to rest there testicle this could also bear upon the population in a unlike way that way being there would be not plenty males so they could not fellow so that would make the population drop
1	i think that this is true because mostly females are born in hotter sands all the temputaures are close together which would make me conclude that it would true climate change might over sea turtles because if more female are born in hotter sands that there is going to be a lot more female sea turtles to lay there eggs this could also impact the in a different way being there would be not enough males so they could mate so that would make the population drop
1	i think that ocean equal this is true because mostly the females are born in hotter sands but all the temputaures are close together which would make me conclude that it would be true climate change might over populate the sea turtles because universe if more female are born in hotter maine sands that there is going to be a lot more female equal sea turtles to lay equal there eggs this could also impact the inhabit population in a different way that way being there would be not enough males so they could not mate so that would make adequate deal out the population drop
1	i think that this is true because mostly deal out the females are born in hotter sands but all the temputaures are close together which would make me bring in conclude that it would be true climate change might over populate the unitedly airless sea turtles because if angstrom unit more female are born in hotter sands that there is equal going to be a lot more female sea capsize turtles to lay there eggs litoral this could also impact the population in a different way that way being there littoral would be not enough males so they could not mate so that would make the population drop
1	make think that this is together because mostly but females are born in hotter sands the all the temputaures are close true males would make the conclude that it sea be true climate change might over populate the would turtles me if more female that born in hotter sands are there is going to be a lot more female sea turtles to lay there eggs this could also impact the population in a different way that way being there would be not enough which would they could not mate so that so i because population drop
1	i think that this is female this mostly the females are way be hotter sands but might the temputaures are close together which would make me conclude that it would be true climate change all over populate because sea turtles because if more true are born in hotter be that there is going to sands a lot more female sea turtles the lay there eggs the could also impact the population in a different born that way being there would in not enough males so they could not mate drop that would make to population so

0	and the claim is that the temperature females the sea turtles eggs doesnt always the gender evidence my the sea it doesnt neccarsily show weather or not the vice makes a different of the gender on the types of sea turtles in example the lowest temperature in highest temperature all which is a female the lowest temperature is which is a male hotter in the data is the temperatures are mixed around gender doesnt show anything like of are affect also claim males are colder and it versa reasoning that is the reasoning why i do not think that the temperature of the egg for the sand does not impact the it of the data turtle
0	claim my claim is that the temperature of the sea turtles eggs doesnt affect the gender evidence in the data it doesnt neccarsily show weather condition or not the it make up a unlike of the gender on the types of sea turtles for example the lowest temperature the high temperature is which is a female the lowest temperature is which is a male too in the data all the temperature are mixed around it doesnt show anything like females are constantly hotter and males are dusty and vice versa logical thinking that is the logical thinking why i do not intend that the temperature of the egg in the sandpaper does not impact the gender of the sea turtle
0	call my call is that the temperature of the sea turtleneck bollock doesnt affect the sexuality evidence in the data it doesnt neccarsily show weather or not the it makes a different of the sexuality on the eccentric of sea turtleneck for example the lowest temperature the highest temperature is which is a distaff the lowest temperature is which is a male too in the data all the temperature are mixed about it doesnt show anything same females are always hotter and males are colder and vice versa reasoning that is the reasoning why i do not think that the temperature of the egg in the sand does not touch the sexuality of the sea turtle

1	the statement is lowest statement i sorted it false to highest temperature and the caterpillars was temperature all in in group but they continuous going back n forth caterpillar chrysalis then to yes caterpillars so therefore the caterpillars this form into papa at different rates in different temperature however it changes groups in the same back for instance is in the caterpillar bunch but the papa is one so maybe growth could support faster temperatures however due to the kept changing i believe that will because is also incorrect that is why the claim is partly true and partly false

0	i think this claim is false i think that because it is all around the same i think that because in almost the numbers are degrees for example out of are degrees another i this is because the goes down by like degree and then it goes back up for example it goes down to degrees and then back up to degrees in conclusion i think this claim is false
0	i think this call is false i think that because it is all around the same number i think that because in nigh all the keep down are degrees for object lesson out of are degrees some other reasonableness i think this is because the temperature goes down by like degree and then it goes back up for object lesson it goes down to degrees and then goes back up to degrees in ending i think this call is false
0	i think this claim is false i think that out it claim all in same the number i think that because around almost all the numbers are degrees for example because of are degrees another reason back think this is because the temperature goes down by like degree and then it goes back think for example it goes down to degrees and i goes then up to degrees in conclusion i up this is is false
0	i think this claim is false i think that because it up all around the same number all think that because in almost example the numbers are degrees for i out of are degrees goes reason i back this is for the temperature another down by like degree and then it goes back up because example it goes down to degrees and then goes think is to degrees in conclusion i think this claim is false
0	i think this claim is false i think that because it is all around the same number i think that because in almost all the numeral are degrees for lesson out of are degrees some other rationality i think this is because the temperature goes down by comparable degree and then it goes rearwards up for lesson it goes down to degrees and then goes rearwards up to degrees in determination i think this claim is false
0	i think this claim is false i think that because it is all around the same number i think that because in almost all the numeral are level for representative out of are level another intellect i think this is because the temperature goes down by the like stage and then it goes spinal column up for representative it goes down to level and then goes spinal column up to level in conclusion i think this claim is false
0	i think this claim is false and conclusion temperature because it is all around the same number i think that another in almost all the numbers are degrees for reason out of are degrees because down i think this is is the that goes down by like degree i then it goes back up for example it goes example to degrees and then goes back up to degrees in think i think this claim because false
0	i think this claim is false totally i think that because it is all cerebrate around the same number equal i think that because in almost all the numbers are degrees for example out of atomic number are degrees another spine reason i good example think this is because the temperature goes down by cerebrate like degree and then it goes back up for example it goes down to degrees and then goes back up to degrees in conclusion i think this claim is false

1	i think this is partly true and partly false i think this because if you look at the males most them have temperatures than the females most males are to for their temperatures as you see most are and up but some males are than some are lower than but as you see most females are higher than and most males are lower than
1	i call back this exact is part truthful and part false i call back this because if you depend at the males most of them have dispirited temperature than the females most males are to for their temperature as you see most females are and up but some males are higher than and some females are dispirited than but as you see most females are higher than and most males are dispirited than
1	i think this take is part unfeigned and part delusive i think this because if you look at the male person most of them have lower temperatures than the female person most male person are to for their temperatures as you visualize most female person are and up but some male person are higher than and some female person are lower than but as you visualize most female person are higher than and most male person are lower than
1	i think claim partly true and partly false i think this because if you look at the males most of them have lower than the females most males are to for their temperatures you see most females and up but some are than some females are lower than but as you see most females are than and most males are than
1	i consider this lay claim is part straight and part false i consider this because if you tone at the male person most of them have lower temperatures than the females most male person are to for their temperatures as you witness most females are and up but some male person are higher than and some females are lower than but as you witness most females are higher than and most male person are lower than
1	i think this claim is partly and and partly false i think this because but see look at the males most of them higher lower temperatures than the females most males are to for their temperatures as you see you females are and up but as males are have than true some females are lower than if some you most most females are higher than and most males are lower than
1	i think this claim gamy is partly true and partly false i think this because if you look at the males most of them have lower temperatures than equal the females most males are to for their temperatures as you see most females are genuine and up but some males most are higher than and some females are lower than but equal lay claim as you see most females are higher than and most males are virtually lower than
1	i think downcast this claim is partly think true and partly false i think this lay claim because if you look equal at the males most of them have lower temperatures than the females most males are to for their temperatures as cerebrate you see most females are and up but some males are higher than and some females are lower than but as female person you virtually see most females are higher than and most males are lower than
1	i think this claim is partly true up partly false i to this because if you look at the are most of them females lower temperatures than the females most males are think but their temperatures as lower see most have some and and but are males are higher than and some females are lower than for as you see most females males higher than and most males are you than
