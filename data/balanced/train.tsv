0	because
0	I think this is false because the count goes from like 90 to 400 to 30.  On the graph it goes from 50 to 200 to 900.  900 is the most.  If it stayed the same most of the data would be in a line.
1	The table shows that lower temperatures are males and higher temperatures are female
1	Yes this is true because I sorted the temps from low to high, and on average the lower temps were all male hatching. and the high temps were all female, so yes there is a correlation between sand temperature and the the gender of the eggs of leatherback turtles.
0	it went from 33.50 to 909.50

0	I think this claim is partly true partly false because it has to be a certain temperature for a cryselis to form.
0	its partly true because sea turtles do lay there eggs in the sand its partly false because the sand temperature does not help the eggs hatch into a boy or a girl
1	sometimes the female leatherbacks are born around 84 degrees to 87 degrees.
1	In the data if we take the oldest date and the newest date, we will see that the water is accutaully is increasing.
1	"For the first 2 data reports, both ""butterflies"" were outside. 2\'s butterfly was outside in warmer weather, and was a chrysalis already. 1\'s butterfly\'s was in a cooler weather than 2 so warmer weather does speed up the life cycle of a butterfly."
0	The reason why I think it is false is because it can't be true.
1	I think it is false. So look at the chart at 1960 the temperature is 84.56 but almost every year after that it has been 85 or 86 but some have been 84 but most are higher on 84. But on 1964,1970 and 1972 are all lower but it said that it has been decreasing since 1960 which means every year after that but way more are higher plus the last year is 85.57 which is also higher.
1	I think this claim is true because, when I organized the data by temperature, I saw some patterns. First, when the eggs were in the 54 - 59.36 degree range, they were all caterpillars. Second, when the eggs were in the 59.37 - 60.90 degree range, they were a mixture of caterpillars and chrysalises. Lastly, when the eggs were in the 60.91 - 64 degree range, they were all chrysalises. That is why I think the claim is true. The temperature of a monarch butterfly's habitat does affect how quickly it goes through its life cycle stages.
0	when they keep tract of them they can see were they are Going
0	the article said so
0	I think that the temperature can affect how fast the butterfly goes through it's life cycles because you don't want the temperature to be too hot or too cold, so I think that the outside was perfect temperature because if it was too hot the butterfly would probably not be able to grow as fast but you would want kind of hot so a little hotter then warm. You don't really want it to be that cold for a butterfly because then it won't grow fast you barely want any cold.
0	3 males were born in very hot sand and 2 females were born in coldsand
0	Because more and more butterflies come there each year.
1	The sand temperature affects whether leather-back eggs hatch as male or female because scientific research proves that when the eggs have been laid in warmer sand, the turtle is a female. When the egg is laid in cooler sand, the turtle is a male. Also, These turtles have been laid in different locations. So we know that in Playa the turtles don't tend to be female. That part is totally random. The Male and Female's were both scattered around Playa and Surname.
0	its false because we don't have enough information.
1	the temp is increasing
1	I found that the butterflies grow more in warmer weather.   The butterflies in 54 degrees were still in the caterpillar stage.  But in the 62 degree range they were in the chrysalis stage.  That shows they grew more.
0	This answer is false because looking at the temperature range, it's staying in the same range from 1960 and up.
1	females only hatch above 85 degrees and males hatch at 85 degrees and lower
1	I think it is true because in the data the lower temperature the more males and the higher temperature the more females.
0	because if its to cold it might freeze, killing the butterfly, and if its to warm or hot it could die of exhaustion or it could over-heat causing the stages of a butterfly to slow down.
0	The numbers of the butterfly is not the same
1	The highest temperatures of sand are normally when females are born. The lowest temperatures are mostly male.
1	i think this claim is true because when the temperature  is warmer most of the butterflies stay inside. When, the temperature is colder most of them stay outside to make there chrysalis.
0	i think the claim is false because the number of butter flies has changed
1	when it is the warmer climates the eggs are female and when the climates are below 85  they are male
0	they won be dead of the temprchor.
0	I think is true its because the monarch butterflies like it warn in Mexico.
1	higher the temperature the more females hatched
0	it is the same speed going throne life size.
0	hdjhvjusdnvh
0	because in the 1990s there was maybe half 84 and half 85 but in the 2000s it is  more 84 than 85 I sorted it by year so I could see the difference between years in order I just checked if it was not just the 2000s they were talking about but it did not matter.
0	because it said it in the reading
0	I think this clam is false, Because well I was reading it said that we have to keep estimating the range, Because more Monarch Butterfly's keep coming to the perfect whether in Mexico to the forest.
0	it goes up and down in the data.
0	in mexico the count of marnark butter fly stay the same because it is always worm there
0	fight
0	Sample 1 & Sample 2 were about the same temp but were Male and Female.But in Sample 23 & 24 the temp was 4 degrees different,but were also Male and Female.
1	When I was looking at the evidence, I noticed that all of the males were in sand of the temperature 85.19, and lower. all of the females were born at the temperature of 84.20 and higher. So to conclude the males are born at colder temperatures, and the females were born at slightly warmer temperatures.
0	all the temperatures are reasonably close to each other
1	I think that the graf maps it clear that the populaeshun is going down.
0	I think this is Partly True/Partly False because if you look at 1960 #24 the temperature is 84.56 F. Then in 1968 it decreases #14 to 83.75 F. So far its true but then in 1988 #5 it increases to 85.59 F and it really just keeps this process going over and over.
1	The claim is false because I sorted it lowest to highest temperature and the caterpillars was yes, all in one group, but they kept going back 'n' forth. Caterpillar, chrysalis, then back to caterpillars. So therefore the caterpillars will form into papa at different rates in different temperature, however, it changes groups in the same temperature!For instance, 59.36 is in the caterpillar bunch, but, the papa is in 59.54.So maybe temperatures could support faster growth, however, due to the continuous changing i believe that this statement is also incorrect. That is why the statement is partly true, and partly false.
0	I think its true because it depends on the weather.And if is hot or cold 
1	I believe that the sand temperature affects whether leatherback eggs hatch as male or female and here's why. because the lower 80s are mostly male the middle temp. 80s are a good mix, and the high 80s are mostly female.
0	I know the claim is partly true and partly false. I know this because The hot sand produces females and cold sand produces male turtles. the partly part is because in the middle of the graph, it's a mix of male, and female babies. I sorted it this way because the question was on the temperature of sand.
1	I think this is true because if you look at the temperatures 84 degrees and up are all females and if you look at the male temperatures they are all 86 and under.
0	It is true because the temp. is just like the other female temp. so that is why I think it is true.
0	I think this claim is false. I think that because it is all around the same number. I think that because in almost all the numbers are 85 degrees  for example 17 out of 29 are 85 degrees. Another reason I think this is because the temperature goes down by like 1 degree and then it goes back up. for example it goes down to 84 degrees and then goes back up to 85 degrees.in conclusion i think this claim is false
0	i dont know
1	I think the claim is true because the graph shows that the highest temperature shows that the catupiler is in its chrysalis the coldest temperature the butterfly was still a catipiller.
0	because it starts from caterpillar to chrysalis, then it ends with a caterpillar not a butterfly.
0	i think it is true because it said people reached the butterfly so i think it is true if they said they reached the butterfly mexico it has to be in the right temperature not to warm or to cold.
0	The Heights of sand go up and down through the years
1	The caterpillars all went into their pups when the temperature was 59 degrees (F) or higher.
0	The temperature of the sand shouldn't affect the eggs because when you look at your data table you can see there is no clear pattern for the temperatures to prove that there is a way for the temperature to affect whether leatherback eggs are hatch as male or female.
0	I think this claim is false because as you can tell with the years sorted in this order, you can see how the temperatures go up, down, up, down.  I notes that toward the end in the parts the temp raised! I think it's safe to say this claim is false. on the chart, the green circle represents the temp dropping and the blue circle represents the temp rising. these are just two examples of this.
0	Because if its cold the monarch will die because it does not have much fat on it so if will freeze to death
0	lb
1	because the butterfly count goes down a lot ever 1 to 2 years
1	when outside it  chrysalis's faster and it's warmer outside
0	because there are no data that the monarch butterfly has stayed in one place for many times in a row. it did not come back in 2013 but they did come back in 2014. so it is false they did not stay in on place for a while
1	In 1968 the temperature was 83.75 and in 2002 the temperature was 86.72 so it was going higher
1	I think the claim is true because outside it is 56.84 degrees  and the butterfly is in the caterpillar stage. The other one says that it is 59.54 degrees and the butterfly in in it's chrysallis stage.
1	If a monarch butter was in a cold temperature area it would take longer because its to cold but if it was really warm the process would go quicker.
1	Why I think it is false is pretty simple. If you look at the table or diagram then it shows in 1960 the temputare of the sand was 84.56 degrees F. And then go 2014 the temputuare is 86.16 degrees F. So that would lead me to believe that the temputuare of the sand is increasing not decreasing.
0	i dont know
1	I think this statement is false because I put the temperature in a graph and it seemed to be increasing.
1	The dots on my graph  are all over the place. It goes by the year and count by millions. Some dots are near the bottom and some are near the top. In my chart the numbers range from 33.50 million to 909.50.
1	The temupature since 1860 has been going up until 2000s and started to go down and up.
1	I think that it is false because when it is winter all of the butterfly go to  Mexico. So wen they go there every winter the population will go up.
0	The reason i said it was partly true was because 2006 2005 2007 where about the same but years like 2018 2017 are not the same at all.
1	all the females are at a higher tem like 85 butt the males are lower like 80 but some males are at 85 too and some females are as low as 84
0	They when to know how the left skole goes so they keep track of the butterfly.
0	i think true because in australia they have rain and sun some times and i think that would affect them in australia
0	I think the numbers change depending like how much food threat or the temperature or the breeding.
1	in the year 2016 the temperature was higher than in 1960
1	Because the monarch butterfly in mexico close to this year is dropping, dropping, and rising, it's never stayed in one place like the tens without bumping up a bit.
0	the temperature does affect the life cycle of butterflies according to the evidence on the table.
1	It has not decreased since 1960 it actually risen a little bit. Because, if you look on the chart 1960 the temperature was 84.56 put then in about ten years it dropped down a little bit but then rose back up, In 2002 the temperature was 86.72. It has risen 1.26 in the temperature.
0	I think it is true because if it is cold it is harder for them to turn into a butterfly because it is so cold outside. Another example is if it is really hot outside then it would be hard for the crystal to change because it is so hot.
0	The reason why is because heat can change how will it goes thought it's cycle because it can shell up and it could die in the cold due to the texture drop.
0	I think it is not engine because it do not say that it is
1	I think this claim is true because when the monarch butterfly was outside and the temperature was at 56.84 it was only a caterpillar. But when a different monarch butterfly was also outside at a temperature of 59.54, it was already  in a chrysalis.
1	the butterfly population has gone down in 1996 it was at 909.50 in. 2013 it is at 33.50.
0	The number of butterfly have continuously been going up and down each year some dropping my the millions but the number is always changing each year making me say that this claim is false and that the number of butterflies has stayed the same each year. the lowest the butterfly population has been was in 2013 and the most is has been was in 1996 the numbers are way different than this author said.
0	It goes down and goes up
1	the males are at the bottom and some in the middle, the females are at the top there are three in the middle. Also it said in the beginning that the temperature determines if they are male or female.
0	If you look at the data you will see the data I highlighted their is a Temperature the same and they are Male and Female.
1	It has decreased over the years in 1996 it was 909.50 and in 2013 it was 33.50. It has decreased a lot over the years so that statement is false. it almost went down 890.50
1	The chart clearly shows the population decrease from 909 million to 33 million and maybe it is due to natural causes or something happened  on the way
0	Beaches the heat does not damage it but it could
0	I said it is false because when I looked at the data as the year went higher the temperature moving up. For example, in 1960 the temperature was 84 degrees and in 2014 it was 86 degrees.
0	The claim is false because one Monarch it grew up at 59.54 degrees, and it is in the 3rd stage of growing which is the chrysalis. While a Monarch who grew up in warmer temps at 63.14 degrees is at the same step in there life cycle the chrysalis. And that is why this claim is false
0	you got to save the travel
1	I think it is true because male eggs like the sand cooler then female eggs like the sand .The male eggs like 80 to 85 degrees and female like it 84 to 88 degrees.
0	dot no
0	I think false because I assorted the data table by lowest to highest year and from 1960-2016 the range in temperature stayed within  83-86 it could not be decreasing.
1	The count overall got smaller.
1	I made a graph to show whether the temperature has been decreasing or not and the graph showed me that the weather has been increasing. So, it is false the weather has not been decreasing
0	a male was born i 86.54 temp
0	Because it takes time for it to go through the stages. The temperature could change it maybe a little bit but not a lot for it to change how quick the stages go by.
0	because all the year I saw were all different yes. but, one of the things it showed that in 2002 86.72 for the heat in ('F). it shows that in 1994 in was 85.57  for the heat in ('F.
1	When the temperature is higher the butterfly is turning into a chrysalis and soon the chrysalis is turning into a monarch butterfly.
0	In 2013, the population was 33.50 million, but in 1998, it was almost 30 times that! Not much more to say.
0	i think its true because the temperature affects whether leatherback eggs hack then they will die
0	the reason i think this is false is because marco that not manager come to  main
1	In 1960 the sand temperature was 84.56 and in 2016 the sand temperature was 85.57. So clearly it has not been decreasing it has actually been increasing.
0	On the chart after 1960 it sometimes get higher and sometimes lower.
0	I think its true because in the important data its says the temperature can change if its a girl or boy
1	Every chrysalis tested had a temperature between 59 degrees and 63 degrees. The majority of  the chrysalises were inside.Every caterpillar tested was between 54 and 60 degrees. Most caterpillars were outside. the locations for both were very close between more inside or more outside. Overall, I think it is partially true is because it is true, but the difference in temperature ranges was very small and might not mean anything. Also, the location may or may not have made a difference.
0	this is boring
0	It was warm and it grew and it was cold and it grew the same time.
0	because it says that on the recording page and every year it gets lower
0	I really don't know
0	in 2018 there was 302 and in 1995 there where 630 and in 1996 there was 909 and in 2013 there was 33 so I think that that claim is false.
0	when I sorted the temperatures from lowest to highest the highest temperature was in 2002 so i do not think they have been going down since 1960
0	no because it goes from 85.21 to 86.72 also it keeps going from 84 to 85.
0	i don't know you tell me
0	It is true because from 1993 to 2018 it has stayed very close .The count is off by 9.00 million monarch butterflies.
0	As seen in the chart sample one is shown the highest. If you look underneath it you can see sample number 27 and 26. This shows that the climate of the island has not changed very much. Yes, the last test is showed low but most of the other tests show high temperatures.
1	from different years it goes up and down but It seems that Its increasing than decreasing. In 2002 and up its going up in heat that getting colder in those years so I presently don't  think its decreasing I think its increasing.
0	The years are going up and the temperature is not getting warmer or colder it is staying in the 83.0-87.0 range
0	i think that it is party true and partly false. i think this because even though it is about the same  doesn't mean that it did not drop before.
0	I think it is true because if it hurting the eggs then it will start to hurt the baby turtle inside and that means there might not be anymore turtles after this!
0	I think that the temperature effects how quickly it goes threw its life cycle stages partly true/partly false. Because when it is inside it has no place to do its stages and its temperature is to high or low. Also, It is different when its a chrysalis because, whether inside or outside its about the same temperature either way.
0	i dont know
0	I think its partly true and partly false because some of the male and females have almost the same exact temperature and some of them have lower or higher temperatures so it can be either gender depending on the goodness or the warmth of the sand or the eggs.
0	The number (in millions) goes up every year. that is NOT staying at around the same number.
1	in 1960 the temperature was 84.56, but in 2016 the temperature is 85.57. it is going just a little higher
0	I think its only Party True / Partly False. I think this because if you look at the data you will see mainly in one locations its true about the claim but once you look at both you see that it's its not all true. Because for example #28 and #2 Work then if you look at another pair such as #22 and #26 it doesn't work in the slightest if you compare with the first example.
0	if it was cold it probably not hatch
0	sometimes it did turn into a chrysalis, and sometimes it didn't. Iv'e heard that it depends how much food it has.
0	Because the numbers on the chart.
0	well some years it was decreasing and some years it was getting hotter so i dont know if thats a true fact that ever since 1960 the sand temp has been decreasing
0	Because the temperature has been going up and down since 1960-2016.
0	I don't think it really matters were they are born or what temp it is they will be any gender really think surname has more boys than girl and playa has more girls than boys.
1	One reason why I think that is partly true partly false is if that were true then either 1 or 25 would NOT be the same gender as they are because number 1 (85.80) is only .61 hotter than 25 (85.19). I think it is partly true to because the the data shows Females average 85 and a half maybe more and also shows the Males average 84 and a half so that is why I think that it is partly true and partly false.
0	because they go to mexico in winter
1	The graph provided with the investigation shows that commonly the higher temperature sands normally have hatching female turtles unlike hatching male turtles that do their thing in colder sands. Now in the graph, some male turtles hatch in warmer sands than female hatching turtles but not as often as the other way around. I still stick with my decision with true with my reasons conveniently said and the graph for evidence
1	its not the same. the population has jumped around but has gotten smaller. it slowly gets smaller.
0	it is very important to know understand protect these beautiful  animals
0	the global warming is affecting the sand which makes it to hot
0	because of their ar fewer turtles
0	The weather is not going down. I know that because in 2002 it was just about the same temperature as it was in 2012.
0	in 1960 it was 84.56 (f) then in 2016 it was 85.57 (f). that is why.
0	I thinks it is true because a Leather back  can have male or female. some male and female have temper in there body that makes it feel warm or cold.
1	Most of the chrysalis's are in warmer temps and most of the caterpillars are in cooler temps however, there are a noticeable amount of caterpillars in with  the chrysalis's.
1	I think this is false because the temperatures are around the same number in the 80's.
0	because very one of them are different numbers
1	My claim is that the temperature that a chrysalis is in depends on how fast it grows into an adult because, if the temperature is 50 that is not normal for a butterfly to grow in the average temperature is around 60 degrees Fahrenheit. So if it was 50 degrees it would be below what they are used to so it would grow slower.
0	i think it is false because the sand cant get colder only the water can
0	I think this is partly true and partly false because, when I sorted the data lowest temperature to highest, the lowest temperatures had mostly caterpillars. When I looked at the higher temperatures it had mostly chrysalises.There were still a few caterpillars in the high temperatures so I think this fact is partly true,partly false
0	The temperatures have not been decreasing they have been staying around 85 degrees the coldest its been there is 84 degrees.
1	I think that claim 1 is true because when the sand gets hot its most likely that a female will hatch. So when it gets colder some of the males will be born so what I am saying is whenever the sand gets hot a female comes out. Whenever the sand is cold and warm a male will come out.
0	on the chart it shows that the temperature has decreased and in crested over time making this evidence true
1	because if it is could the cocoon is cold then it might freeze and when i am outside in the winter i do not see cappella's  or butterfly's. In the summer i think it would be much quicker.
0	how it migrated it changes treat the wind
1	Because most of the lower temps. are caterpillars and most of the higher temps. are chrysalis.
0	I think this because some years there very little and some years there was a lot.
0	because in 1996 there was 909 and a half million and in 2013 there is only 33 and a half million
0	it will stay the same because it is warm all year around
1	I think this claim is false because at 1960 it was 84.56. But if you look at my evidence two years after it was 85.10. Through the years the temperature has been getting higher and is not decreasing. Also the temperature got up to 86.72 which has not decreased from 1960. So the temperature of the sand in Rain Island is not decreasing.
0	it might of been decreasing because of the weather
0	Usually, a caterpillar needs its time to hatch into a butterfly. That's whether try to find the best place in a warm and slightly cold place like California and Mexico. If you don't know. On Day 11 the Chrysalis did not hatch faster or slower. It usually stays outside more than inside
1	the population of monarch butterflies has severely gone down from 1996 to 2013
0	i think that if the temperature where to change the speed of the butterfly's growth then all the factors in the butterfly's life would change the speed of the butterfly growth and its life cycle i think maybe the winter could make them die so that why they go down to other areas such as Mexico and based on the data it says that the chrysalis was in 63 degree weather and that was the top degrees in this hole graph so that shows that the weather doesn't speed the life cycle of the monarch butterfly's.
0	I believe the claim is false because in my graph the temperature has shown increase from the year 1960.
0	I think its true because males and females are different just like a girl and boys are different and turtles need the right temperature to have baby turtles yes playa and surname is a place that I dont know it is very warm 80 degree of the sand is very warm for baby turtles baby turtles need the same temperature same of the two places have different temps turtles are baby the sand might be too hot or too cold turtles need the right place the also need the weather to be warm to go in the cold water because the water will be even more cold if there is not sun the water will be warm
0	the numbers ether drop or raise depending on the year
0	Because the temperature is higher.
1	Because some male temps are low that means that females are high temps. But some males are quite high in temps.
0	Because it is not straight line.
0	The temp goes up by a degree and then one year it will go down by a degree.
1	i think it is  true because in this story it said it was faster when it was warm and not when it was cold
1	I think false because, They been going down in the last few years. Also when it goes down also the year is too so this shows something to do with us! Thats why I think its False.
0	It is true because when I put the years from lowest to highest so that is why I think it is true.
0	I think that is partly true and partly false because overtime in 1960 the temperature was 84 degrees it did get hotter but it did call down sometime but gobble warming witch is making the weather warmer also it goes down and up so i guess it is kind of the same
0	because some butterfly's moved to other places in the world they did not just stay in one place.
0	I think it is because if its cold the butterfly might freeze and if they are warm they will have a longer lifespan and they migrate so if the to some place warm and the temperature changes they might die
0	it is going down then it goes up up up it decret ones then got even better
0	I think that the  sand tempechure WNT change whether  a sea turtle caches a boy or girl. Because i looked at the data table and saw that mostly  regardless of the  temechure ita an even chance.
1	I think this claim is true because when the temperature rises, there seem to be more females. between 84.20-85.19 it is kinda scattered but in general, it seems like the lower the temp. the more males, but the higher the temp. the more females. since this claim doesn't go into many specifics, I think we could say yes, the sand temperature affects the gender of the turtles.
1	well most females in the data are born in 85.50 degrees  or more and most males are born below 85.50 degrees. all but 2 females are bore in less 80.50 degrees. and there not 1 male is born in more that 80.50. so its not exactly true but it is party true
0	Because it is true
0	I think that the sand temperature in Rain Island has not been decreasing since 1960 because the temperature numbers have just kind of been scattered around after I organized the data by year.
0	it dose not mater.
1	Look at 1968, 83.75 degrees, and then look at 2016, 85.57 degrees the temperature goes higher not lower.
1	i believe that the sand can affect the gender some times because in the data that shows has the highest temperatures on top with the lowest on bottom and almost all of the high temps are female rather than male one of the highest temps is 88.08 and is female as well as 87.09, 86.97, 86.54, 86.26, those are the highest temps and they are all female the lowest temperature of the female in this test is 84.20 but most of the males is 83.31, 83.25, 82.45, 82.29, the highest of the males in this test is 85.19 quite low to the female turtles. I did say that this thought was partly true/partly false for these reasons
1	because in the hotter temperature the female eggs hatched
1	It hasn't stayed about the same because if you look at the amount of butterflies in 1996 is higher and the number just keeps going down and down over the years.
0	I think its false because male and female turtles were being born in 85 degrees.The same goes for 84 degrees.
0	Because when it's a girl the temperature is in the 80's and when its a boy the temperature is in the 80's too.
1	I think the claim is false because in 1960 the temperature was 84.66 on Rain island. Over 58 years it has increased and decreased but in 2018 it has gone up to 85.67.
0	because more butterfly's have grown sense 1993 so the population has grown and grown sense then
0	I know why it would be true, because Where it says claim two,  it says that its decreasing.
1	The population went down almost 900 million in only 17 years. The butterfly population went down 13 million in one year. Therefore, the population is going down rapidly!
0	Because the lowest amount of butterflies was in 2013 and their was 33.50 . In the middle is 2008 and their was 253.00. then the largest amount was in 1996 and their was 909.50 butterflies!
0	In my graph, the dots representing the number of butterflies are scattered all over the place, definitely not the same. This proves that the claim is false.
0	I think that this is partly true because at  first it is a egg and then it goes into the caterpillar for a long time then it will go into the chrysalis then the last thing of its cycle is it goes into the butterfly and then it will go to its place to migrate but the place will not be to cold or it will not be to worm  it will  be just right for the butterfly to live in the winter time.
0	I think this is false because number 27 is 2014 and 86 degrees and then we look at 1990 its also 86 degrees and then in 2016 its 85 degrees
1	I said what I said because of males where more cornix born in colder places
0	I think that this is false because when you are a caterpillar you are not inside of you egg or chrysalis. And it says that when the caterpillar is in their chrysalis then are outside of their chrysalis. So like they are not even in it.
0	The Sea turtles, male or female, are born at a temperature of 80 to 90 degrees F.
0	no they are not because other monarch butterfly are migrating there.
0	i'm not good with math
0	I think its False because its not the first one to be the lowest number
1	because its going down every year
0	because i feel like it is true and
0	When I sorted the graph by year, I realized that is g from 33.50 to 302.50!!! i think that the population of butter flies is just rising and falling. If the population is about the same how did it go from 33.50 to 302.50 in five years?! I completely disagree with the statement about the population.
0	the tempocher stead the same
0	every time in two years the temperature was in between 84-86
0	in 2013 there were 33.50 million and in 1996 there was 909.50 million and that is an 876 million difference.
1	the leather back turtles gender is of the heat the females are mostly hotter than the males. the two that i pointed to were a boy and a girl the girls 5 hotter than the boy
0	the population has moved around a lot because it has gone all the way from 33.50 to 909.50 and that is a big difference.
0	If it stayed about the same it would have been in the 30s but now it went from thirty three to 56.50 within a year.
0	because the butterfly make hundreds of more butterfly
0	australias nesting area is the most important nesting area so it cant be decreasing
0	The temperature of the sand in Rain Island, Australia has been decreasing since 1960.
1	I think this claim is true because the caterpillars that were in warmer places have already gone to chrysalis stage. where as the other ones are still in caterpillar stage.
0	I think it's false because in the data It looks like the population for monarch in Mexico is decreasing. In 1993 the population of monarch in Mexico was 311.50. I think it was increasing and now it is decreasing. The highest year on the data chart is 2017 the population is 124.00 in 2017.
0	I think that it's false, because there most likely  be a way for the sand does the turtles gender's.
1	I think this claim is false because if you look at the evidence you see that it has barely going up, and it has stayed in the 80's for most of the years.
0	it does not ladder about the weather. It just ladders what the turtle gave birth to in the eggs.
0	if the caterpillar is in the cold weather mean it is in a chrysalis it would slow it down the save its energy.
0	i think this because the temperature is going down and then going right back to the temperature it was at before.
0	its more worm down in mexico
0	because if the temperature change  will efeckit and it will not think it is clam.
0	latherback sea turtles are the biggest species. and they can get up to 2000 pounds but the green sea turtle can get up to 500 pounds an live up to 100 years old
0	BASE In HOMEAFOBIC AND I ATE TRANSEGENDER
0	It could be because of rain and the temp in the air around the sand that makes the sand colder. its defiant going down.
1	I think that it is true because when the temperature is higher there are mostly chrysalis and when it is colder there are more caterpillars.
1	Lots of the turtles that were raised in a cooler environment were males. A piece of evidence is from 80.60 to 83.85 are all males. The females are manly in the group with higher temperature. For example from 85.42 to 88.08 are all females.
0	so they know what they are doing
0	yes because i looked at the map type thing and if i'm right it shows the population of the monarch butterfly.the map gives me a good way of seeing the population and im going with that the population is the same now than it was.
0	i think that it is ministre but false
0	The temperatures of a monarch butterfly's can affect the life cycle because for example, the intense heat may interfere with butterfly's natural habitat and life cycle changes and can put heat on monarch butterfly's life cycle by shutting down their organs, or maybe slowing down the process of growing.
0	because more monarch butterfly's are coming in to Mexico
0	so the temp. helps but not to hot
0	I believe that the temperature can maybe change if it is a male or female, but I don't really know.  Some of the results say record that there were 4 males or females in a row at the same place with there temperatures would be different in different places, but they also show in some sections that they can be scattered (one female one day a male a different day). But on the other hand, a female lays there eggs all together in the same place under the sand so the temperature would be very close in the same hole and there are different genders in one hole.  So I think that it can be true or false.
0	The report dos not say it decreases.
1	The top of the Life Cycle Stage List where it is colder has all caterpillars and at the bottom of the list where it is hotter has a lot of chrysalis's I think that when it is warmer they go threw their stages faster and when it is colder they go threw their stages slower
1	why i believe that tempicher effects weather they are male or female because if you look on the cart most male eggs have lower tepicer and female has higher tempicher that is my reason why
1	When you sort the data from low to high,you can clearly see that the claim is partly true. On the lower side of the chart, it is only male but in the middle some of the temps. Run up to 85.19 address. Which was uncommon for the sex. With is why only part of the claim is true.
0	when you look at the graph, you can see it stayed about the same, other than a sudden spike in 1995 and 1996.
0	as you see the years to 1960 to 2016 the 1960 is at 84.56but the 2016 is at 85.57 so it is false
0	I think that the temperature faces the cycle us of the  temp difference of the caterpillar and the chrysalis
0	because mexico is a relay some stat. they wont be dead.
0	The sand temperature does not hove anything to do with if the leatherback being male or female.
0	The data shows that in 1996 the population of the Monarch butterfly was 909.50 and in 2013 the population is 33.50 which shows a gigantic difference through 1996-2013.
0	?
1	Well, when I sorted the data by temperature lowest to highest, I looked at the life cycle stages and first there were a chunk of caterpillar  and then chrysalis  then more caterpillars back and fourth. I think that if the claim was true then all the caterpillars would be together and all the chrysalis would be together.
0	If you put the temperature from lowest to highest and look at the male/  female called, the low temperature is female, and the male is in the high temperature.
1	I think this question is true because when the temperatures are getting warmer there are lots of chrysalis'. But when it is a little colder out there are mostly caterpillars.
0	I think it would be partly true and partly false because the temperature of the sand and rain   island , Australia UT In TxIN In PROBALEY WUL By RE
0	because the temperature is the same all the time or in the same range or temp.
1	on the chart, the temperature has gone not far down and pretty far up. i see that the temp has gone mostly up so it is not decreasing too much.
1	I think it is partly true party false. If you look at the claim it is (the sand temperature affects weather leatherback eggs hatch as male or female.) Then look at the chart male temperature is from 85.19 to 80.60. Then look at female the temperature is from 88.8 to 84.20 so to me it looks like that if there is a higher temperature then there is a female and a lower temperature for a male. But I only think it is partly true partly false because the temperatures 84 and 85 are both in range for them both.
1	I know the temperature of the monarch butterfly's habitat affects how quickly it goes through its life cycle stages is because when I sort the data by cold to hot and most of the hot temperature was the chrysalis meaning they do better in hot places
0	the temperature does not seem to affect the butterfly's life cycle.
0	I think it is partly true because butterfly can stay the same but not that long. I also know that mexico has alot of butterfly.
1	I think that it partially matters what temperature it is for a monarch butterfly to effect how fast it's life cycle goes because when i was looking at the data i noticed that if the temperature was over or at 60.48 then it was more likely to be in a chrysalis.
0	I believe that the claim is false because on the chart in 1960 the temp.was 84.56 and the other years have had a lower temp.And other years the temp. has been higher.
1	I think this claim is partly true because most of the the ones in the 60's are chrysalises and most of the 50's are not
0	I think it's partly true because it shows that inside they are mostly still chrysalis and outside its more of caterpillars
0	Different butterflies are at different stages and the temperature  has nothing to do with how fast the butterfly goes through the stages of its life.
0	if you look at 1,2,and 3 the first is female and the temperature is at 85.80 and then the second one is male the temperature for that one is 85.04 but if you look at the third its female but the temperature is 84.77 which is colder than the males
0	i dont now
0	i think it is true because if there cocoon is frozen then they can't be changing and there stages of becoming a butterfly.That's why i think the temperature matters in a butterfly's habitat.
0	I think it's true because, I think that when it's hot the chrysalis is more likely to be wanting to get out of the chrysalis. The butter fly could also be wanting to dry it's wings on the sun ( because it's hot.)
0	because the butterfly has to go places
0	it has been decreasing but not very fast.
0	because for some reason the heat makes the gender different and the turtles know this so they place their eggs in different places accordingly.
0	because
0	The temperature changes the gender because when they are first laid they sea turtles are are not formed. The sea turtles are really unidentified
1	I say that it is false because the weather is staying at the mid 85-88 and that means it is only getting warmer not colder
0	Because it shows inside and outside and two are both caterpillars but then also one is a chrysalis. That is the same tempachure so kinda true kinda false
0	It says the sand temperature affects whether leatherback eggs hatch as male or female, but scientists figure out when they hatched.
0	If you look at the chart the year 1960 is lowest but then it is increasing not decreasing so I think that claim 2 is false.
0	I think this claim is true because if the temp changes out side the sand changes.
1	The lower temperature they are in the caterpillar stage and in the higher temperature they are in a chrysalis stage.
0	its false because the count is going higher over the years.
0	it can tack longer for some butterfly's to go in to a chrysalis, then others.
1	I think this claim is true because whether sea turtles lay there eggs in the sand and the different temperatures that effect in there eggs shell could change there formation of themselves. To turn into to a male or female. Also I notice that the temperatures stay in the eighties maybe  that also has something to do with it. Males usually in Surname tend to stat around in under the 85's but females on the other hand stay above an 85 maybe that's a reason the come out male or female.
0	Because you have to know the butterfly's temperature if you are going to learn about them
0	I think it is true because different habitats can have an effect on stuff like the food there. not the right food can affect its life stages life, for example, it could be late on becoming a butterfly or like it could be a caterpillar for longer than it should
0	maybe it is because of  partly true/ partly False
1	when i shorter the years i  the new one is the hottest with 85.57 and the last is 84.56
1	I think it's partly true/partly false because from the data outside is kind of warmer then inside and in the higher temperatures the monarchs are already at the chrysalis stage. In the article it said that monarchs move to warmer places in the winter. Places that are not to cold and not to warm. But I also think it is partly false too because looking at the data some monarchs that are inside are in chrysalis.
0	The temperature seems to go up and down each year. It isn't exactly decreasing, but it does go down a tiny bit each year. But then it will rise again, being back to the temperature it was before. I believe it's partly true, but the temperature rises again in a few years,
0	if you look at sample 6 in 1962 the temperature is at 85.10 but then if you look at sample 27 in 2014 its at 88.18
0	The answer to the question is false.  It is false because the information I am getting says that it has gone up a lot more.
0	Sea turtles are kinda the same as people. When they are born the heat doesn't change the gender. For ex: Sample number 3 and 16 They both have 84 as there temperature but one is female and one is male. It depends on if the father gave that egg the X or Y in the chromosomes.
0	because the sometimes they will momentarily leave the area
1	I think the claim is false because in 1996 the butterfly population is 909.50 million and in 2013 the butterfly population is 33.50 million and there is a big difference in 33.50 million and 909.50 million. So the butterfly population has gone down a lot
0	I think claim 2 is false because the population is going up a lot and is almost up to 1000 so i so not think claim 2 is telling the truth.
0	some caterpillar's and chrysalis live in the same location and some are growing faster than others
1	I see that the males mostly hatch in a little colder sand. I also see that the females are mostly born in sand that is a little bit warmer then the males. I think that the fact is partly true because that is not true for some of the turtles.
1	I think true because if a monarch butterfly's habitat is cold then it  will not be able to transfer throw out all of the other stages in its life cycle, but if a monarch butterfly's habitat is warm then it will be able to transfer throw the stages. Just like if a human goes out side in the cold then the fluids inside of your body will not stay warm, but if you are inside and it is warm inside then the fluids in your body will keep running faster throw out your body.
0	i thin that is true because that is wat the data said and thats the soul of life for a outer fly
0	i said no because it says on the top temperature 85.80 and its a female and on the 2nd one down is says 85.04 and its a male
0	The count in millions has changed a lot
0	they cep track of the butrflis and the polplashen it just fin and the botrflis are fin that do what the wont when ever that wont .
1	I think this claim is false because if you see on the data when monarch butterfly's  are inside they can be a caterpillar or a chrysalis. But on the outside it shows that it can be the same as the indoor. Also as you can see lower temperatures and higher temperatures can both be caterpillars or chrysalis's. So I don't believe the temperature affects them or the habitat.
1	When the sand temperature is hotter the eggs hatch as female, and when the sand is cooler the eggs hatch as male. For example, some of the male egg temperature were, 80.60, 82.45, and 83.25. But then some of the female temperatures were, 87.09, 88.08 and 86.54, so there is a big difference in those temperatures which means that the eggs hatch as female when the sand is hotter, and the eggs hatch as male when the sand is cooler.
0	It is false because in 2002 it was 86.72 and in 2008 it was 15.21 but in 1964 it was 84.56
0	I think its false because every year its grows to more counts  but in the claim it said the populations stayed the same every year.
1	The highest temperature was in 2002. The lowest temperature was in 1968. On my graph the temperature was going up and down not just a line going down. If anything the temperature is going up for 1960.
0	I think it doesn't mater
0	I believe that the sand temperature affects whether the leather back eggs hatch as a fem. or male.Because in the article it said that scientist sometimes collect the eggs and control the temp. and then check if they are a fem. or male.
0	because all female turtles lay their eggs on the beach and then she leaves them
1	When the temperature is higher its seems to male it slower because all of the chrysalis is 59 degrees or above and all of the caterpillars are 60 degrees and under. The chrysalis stage comes first and is all a higher temp than the caterpillars stage is after the chrysalis stage and is a lowe temp.
1	i think that this is partly true because the article said that the weather cant be too cold and cant be to warm. i think this could affect how they grow, if the monarch butterfly are in too warm of weather they could not grow properly. if they are in too cold of weather they could take longer to grow, or even worst die. i do agree that it can cause them to to grow. if monarch butterfly are in to warm or harsh weather it could cause the population to go down in stead of up. that is why i think climate can cause butterfly to not grow.
0	I don't think that the temperature affects there gender because they were already made in the costume of the turtle. So if I was in my moms costume and it was hot I don't think that would affect my gender. But this is a hole different animal. But its not able to switch its gender.A mom cant just say i want a girl. that's not possible.
1	We believe this is false because since 1960 the temperatures have risen.
1	I am seeing that the life cycle In affected by the temp. of their habitat.Some evidence that my claim is true is that 60 Degrees *f is when they start turning in to caterpillars but over 60 is chryalises.
0	sample #7 is almost the exact same top as #60
1	Some are saying that the temperature of the sand in Rain Island, Australia has been decreasing since 1960. This information is incorrect. As I have made my graph of data that has been collected from the past years, I have found that the temperatures have gone up since 1960, not gone down.
0	The monarch butterfly stays in mexico because it likes the heat.
1	I think it is not true because it side it was decreasing when it has been going up for the most part it only goes down a little bit!
0	the go throw stages and the winter that are they miller mills from that nachrol habitat
1	i think this claim is partly true and false because monarch count has stayed in the millions but the numbers have gone way lower. since 1996
1	The claim is false because in 1996 their where 909.5 million butterfly's in Mexico. But in 2008 the butterfly population has gone down to 253 million and it decreased from there. Until 2013 where there was only 33.5 million butterfly's in Mexico so it is pretty obvious that the claim is false because the butterfly population went down 876 million in 17 years.
0	I think this is true because the data table shows that the temperature was decreasing lower and lower each time they tested it.
0	it take about a were
1	We believe the temperature of the sand does contribute to male or female eggs.  Male's were primarily hatched in the low 80's to 83 range.  Females were primarily hatched in the 85 - 88 range.
0	The temperature has been mostly the same when you look at the data, so obviously, it wouldn't be decreasing over the years.
1	In 1960 Temperature was 84.56 and in 2016 the Temperature was 85.57 so it increased.
1	according to the chart higher temperatures seem to have female eggs and lower the temperatures seem to have more male. but in the middle of the chart mae and female are a little mixed up.
0	because ofclimat change
0	the temperature is always within 2 degrees
1	i think this claim is false because the data table shows that as years go on the population have been increasing and decreasing. Also thats happening because butterflies go there when it gets to cold or to hot where they live and it degrees when they leave to go somewhere else.
0	because each year more go to Mexico because it's warm in Mexico.
0	It's True because it is the same thing but their are a little difference. They almost have the same patterns.
0	In my graph since the year 1993 it has rapidly increased, rapidly decreased, and mediocrity decreased. Which is the exact opposite of the scientists claims.
1	As I quickly looked through the location, and went onto temperature where I looked and saw that mainly the monarch butterfly does turn into the chrysalis quicker at hotter temperatures whether inside or outside.
0	i dont know
0	Because I said so
0	All of the facts that were included in this text had great details. I think temperature does effect how fast the monarchs go through their life cycle. I think this because if they get to cold when they are in their chrysalis they can freeze on the inside and not grow. Also, if it is too hot for the caterpillar in it's chrysalis it would probably kill them and cause them to not grow anymore.
0	I looked  at the smallest tempsort and it is 2002 With i found helpfullbeculs  In means it is NOT decreasing if 1960 is only 8456
0	If you look at number 26 the temperature is 63.14 and the butterfly is in its chrysalis but if you look at number 29 the butterfly is a caterpillar
1	When you look at the chart pay attention to the numbers of the population. It was going downward! In 1993 the population was 3 million to 1996, 9 million now look at 2013, 33 million! It was in the hundred million not 10 million! You can not say it has stayed the same when it fell down to 10 million. I think the claim is False!
0	because the numbers jump all over the place from high to low.So it seems like it doesnt matter what temperature it is
1	I think that it is partially true because it shows that the warmer the temperature the faster it will grow but, I believe this only goes for when the caterpillar is outside because it seems that when a caterpillar is inside it doesn't grow as quickly because  it's not in it's natural habitat.
0	I think that it is true because they say every winter they migrate Mexico and they estimate the butterfly population every year sense 1993.
1	I think this claim is partly true and partly false. I think this because if you look at the males most of them have lower temperatures than the females. Most males are 85 to 80 for their temperatures. As you see most females are 85 and up. But some males are higher than 85 and some females are lower than 85. But as you see most females are higher than 85 and most males are lower than 85.
1	when the feature became hotter and more dense the butterfly started going through the cycles of their transformation
0	Female or Male they go to warm places where temperature go up to 80 degrees. They always go to warmer places
0	I think it is partly true/ partly false. I think this  if you look at the data, it will go back and fourth between chrysalis and caterpillar. Right in the middle of the data it goes back and fourth. there will sometimes be a caterpillar in the beginning. I believe that it could help to study the location of the butter fly. and if it is inside or outside a building/structure.
0	I think this is true because global warming could change the temperature of the sand.
0	I think that this claim is false because in the graph  made it shows that it did go down on the third year but then it started to increase sense then and it does not seem like it is going down any where.
1	I think this claim is true because all the females numbers are within a couple of numbers of each other. And it is the same for male.I think this because in the data it says on one piece of evidence that it was 85.82 degrees and it was a female then another one said 85.54 and that was a female. another reason i think this is because in the data it says 80.56 and it was a male then another one said 80.60 and that was a male to.in conclusion I think claim 1 is true.
0	because in the picture it was dawn and some time's its cold at night time
1	After 11 days there were more chrysalises when it was warmer and more caterpillars as it got colder. So warmer temps make the monarch butterfly's life cycle go faster.
0	The temperatures
0	if its cold or if its a bigger egg it will hatch more slow if its a bigger or more cold cattipiler will stay in to keep worm
0	hi my name is ................
0	because some places sand and stuff can be a different but id if has been changing
0	yes because 50 50
0	I think when the caterpillar is outside it will get very warm and when the caterpillar is inside it will cool off.
0	I think the scientists are wrong the sands are not going down in temperature and the graph provides the evidence to support. Yes by the graph the sands go up and down every recorded time like it can go up then it can go down then back up then down but the last one is back up which supports my stupid claim
1	Most of the male eggs are hatched in cooler weather, however most of the female eggs are in a little bit warmer weather
0	because if sea turtles don't have enough sand they can't buried there eggs and if they do predators will get to them.
1	The highest count of butterfly was in 1996 and ever since then it has dropped rapidly over the past 17 years. And it has dropped by over 800 million, so it has not been staying the same.
0	because i was watching a lamar beam vid and he said titles are mostly laying eggs in kickoff middle temperature  but i believe hed tell us if they were laying eggs in warm whether or cold whether
0	This is shipping because of the forest fires and polotchiponthat has been happening for years
0	because some eggs need to be incubated and stuff and some dot so maybe the sand can cause it to not you hatch it can take longer
0	i picked partly true and party false because i feel like a butterfly starts asa caterpillar then grows to be a butterfly like other butterfly like ones we have in maine like the ones that come out in the summer and they have to have temperature thats not to hot or cold that is what i think\
0	I think That It's Partly true And Partly False Because When You Look At the chart it Kinda Changes The form By temperature But it Kinda Doesn't.
0	because it is warm water
0	I think that the population has gone up by so much it has gone up by like 800 million
1	In the data shown in the picture it looks like the lower the temperature the slower the life cycle is.The data also shows the higher the temperature the faster the life cycle is.
0	
1	I think this claim is partly true and false because the monarch count has stayed in the millions but the numbers have increasingly have gone way lower sense 1996.
0	At 1998 first to number is getting lower just like what the claim #2 have say about that Rain Island, Australia, has been decreasing since 1960. but then the rest is the increasing then decreasing. I might actually not really know what their meanings are.
0	in 2008 the temperature is 85.21 but in 2002 the temperature is 86.72
1	In 1962 the temperature was at 85.10 degrees. and you keep going up in years the temperature goes up and down depending on the weather. In 2008 the temperature was at 85.21. That is a increase if anything in the temperature. it was a 0.11 increase in heat.
1	If your looking at the chart, the females temperature is much higher than the males but, some of the temperatures are the same for both the genders. Thats why I think its partly true.
0	i think this because everything is different and if it is true when its inside and 59 above it does seem a little true.
0	Since 1960 the temperature has bean in the 80's but it has bean going down but not by much at all
1	If you look at the years under the year 2000 they have all smaller temperatures than the sand in the 2000's. So that means that the temperature increased actually.
0	Most of the monarchs are still caterpillars because it takes a long time to create a chrysalis,and since it takes long to make a chrysalis it is partly true.But if we did the same but with only chrysalis we will see that its just in the middle.
0	because It's mostly the same temperature.
0	because it was in the reading!!!!!
0	ariana
0	I think this is false because in 1960 the temperature was 84.56 and the the temperature in 1962 was 85.10 so its been going up not down.
0	I think this because the graph didn't show anything about the turtle amount.
1	The sand temperature affects whether leatherback eggs hatch as male or female because looking at the data, males have lower temperatures while the females have more.
0	If the monarch butterfly goes through the stages fast then it's probably used to doing something fast and not having the patients to do stuff so that's probably one of it's habit
1	i think it's false because it says they started tracking in 1993 and from 1993 to 2013 the population has gone down instead of staying the same it went from 909 million to 33 million.This is why i think that the monarch butterfly's population didn't stay the same.
0	if you see the evidence you see that the first 2002 thing is 86.72 degrees but in the 2012 one it is 85.06
1	The lower the temperature is, the slower the life cycle goes.
0	i think this claim is false because This table jumps from 556.00 million to 109.50 million
0	is all way hot on a land so they have t o adapt to the heat and there in the sand so the egg are kept cold
0	because the report show that the tempiture doesnt really matter
1	as the temperature ranged from 57-62 the caterpillars turned into stage 3 crysiless depending on the location this could be caused by humidity outside or inside but as it got warmer they changed mostly on the warmer side inside and a little cooler outside again probably from humidity
1	because some are a high temperature and the monarchs are still caterpillars but some of the low temperatures are chrysalises
1	All higher temperatures above 59.50 are in stage 3 or 4 because of how high the temperature is in there location. But just 6 of them are still in stage 2 though.I have thought about it and came up with this theory, they may have been born just went the temperature was warmer and they still are growing fast but just have not made the cut.
0	I believe this claim is false. I believe it to be false because in the graph you can clearly see there is nearly an equivalent amount of male and female leatherback hatching. In addition, they are hatched in the same temperature range of about 80 to 85 Fahrenheit.
1	because most of the time there are male and female sometimes there are just female and sometimes the a just males because male need to be colder to the ground or the won't be a male they will then be a female. female need to be warmer than the males if there to cold they will most likely to be a male
0	As you can see the claim is false one of the female leatherbacks are 82.45 and it was at surname and a different leatherback was 86.97 and it was at surname so it is false
1	every year since 1996 the monarch butterfly population has gone down every time a new year comes so the butterfly population cannot be the same if in 1996 909.50 million butterflies and the in 2013 there are only 33.50 million they have gone down by about 878 million
1	The temperature for male eggs was between 80-86, which is lower than the 84-87 that the female eggs had. I believe that if the egg is warmer, females will hatch. If it's colder, males will hatch.
1	The monarch butterfly population has decreased by millions. The amount in 1996 909.50, to 2013 33.50. That was a HG decrease in population. I should have their job because I even know that.
0	It's false because if you look at the data, there are still some caterpillars that have the same temperature as the ones in the chrysalis's. That means they are in the same temperature as the ones who are growing up faster.
0	if its to cold it will freeze to death and if its to warm its perfect temp for it to live
0	I think that  it is partly Files cup it lakes a long time to              become a butterfly..
1	the weather makes the monarch slow done if it is to cold out they stay as caterpillars and when it is hot they grow up faster. They grow faster if they eat more.they grow slow if it is 61 to 54 farinhitemost of these are still caterpillars because it is still cold
0	vanessa
0	because when my uncle was in the coast caused  had to practice scuba diving and when he did did they boat like a almost 100 year old turtle in i think i said i think to do something with it he never told me what he did with the turtle
0	because in 1960 the sand temperature was 84.56 and in and in 1972 it was 84.20
1	i think its partly true and partly false because number 1 and  2 are both 85 degrees and one is male and ones female but numbers 19 and 20 is a big different 19 is 80 degrees and its a male and 20 is 86 degrees and a female
0	The temperature has been increasing not decreasing. The graph helps me see that.
0	The graph shows that the temps of the sand have decrease but in some years they got higher.
0	This claim is false because there is barely a decline in temperature. If you were to say that there is a decline you would need to know it only drops down 1 degree every few years. In the graph, you can see that in 2000,1994, 1992, 1974, 1988, and 1962, it stays 85 degrees Fahrenheit.
0	Most eggs don't hatch with warm weather but they also can hatch themselves.
1	all of the chrysalis are 60 or above and all of the caterpillar are below 59
0	i think  it is false because they don't rush right throw  there life cycle
0	In the chart to the right in the outside with the crystals is almost the exact same outside with a caterpillar
0	Because I think that sand can not be wash away from the tech the humans
0	the
1	in the lower temperature there are mainly males till 84.20 then it is mixed till 85.42 where the rest are al female
1	I think its partly true/ partly false because in some parts it's colder than the warm temperature and it still said chrysalis.
0	I think its wrong because there are similar temperatures and some die as a caterpillar and some die in a chrysalis. for example, there is one where it's 60.90 and it dies as a caterpillar then there's one where its 60.98 and it dies as a chrysalis.
0	because it will still be in the 50 or 60 degrees if it is outside or inside
1	If you look at the temperatures from lowest to highest, you see that all the lowest temperatures say caterpillar and the higher temperatures say chrysalis. This shows that the temperature of the habitat affects how quickly monarch butterfly's life cycle stages change.
1	In 1996 the count was 909.50 million and just a year after it dropped to 630.50 and all the way up in 2013 the count was 33.50 million so it has dropped about 880 million.
0	ariana
1	The higher temperature are mostly female and the lower temperature are mostly male. I said partly true partly false because some male sea turtles are high temperatures and some female sea turtles are in the lower temperatures.
1	Each year the count goes done
0	If your looking at the chart, all the temperatures are around 83,85, and 84. Which means they haven't been decreasing at all.
0	In 1996 there were 909.50 mil butterflies. But in 2013 there were 33.50 mill and that is not a lot.
0	I believe that the temperature of the monarchs habitats does not depend on the monarchs habitat temperature. The reason that it doesn't depend on the  temperature is because the results vary between inside and outside of the temperature of the chrysalis. One of the temperature for the chrysalis is 59.54 Fahrenheit  and another is 63.14 Fahrenheit that is a 4 degree difference. Also the colder one is outside and  the hotter one is inside. That's why i Believe that the temperature does not matter for a monarch caterpillar to turn into a chrysalis.
0	i think its false because it said that they hatch in the sand and go find safety in the sea they don't  say anything about having a special feature.
1	As you can see in the data...over the years the butterfly population in Mexico has changed. There were way more butterflies in the 90's. in the 2000's the numbers died down , but in the early and late 2010's it slowly started rising again.
0	Yes the temperature slowly defended from 86 degrees to 85 then to 84 then back up to 85. So in conclusion the temperature did go down by about a degree.
0	i think this is false because the evedace shows the number of butter go up
1	The temperature was going up.
0	it is because the lay a baby every 1 month
0	"in 1996 the butterfly population in Mexico was 909.50 million. But scientists say that the population has always been about the same?! thats not possible. Because the earliest time they have so far is in 2018. and in 2018 there were only 302.50 million butterfly\'s. So i think the scientist who stated this is very off. 909.50 compared to 302.50 is a big difference, the butterfly population in Mexico has not ""stayed the same."""
0	global warming
0	I think its true because number 1 is 2002 its 86.72 and number 14 its 1968 its 83.75 its getting lower and I know Deccriceing means going down
1	yes because of its temporal is raising.
0	Because as the data shows from 1996 to 2013 the number of butterfly has gone down a big number. So what clam two is saying is that the numbers has stay the same but looking at the data you can see that is not true.
0	i think that because they can both be man or female
0	because it not changing
0	because the heat goes but it also goes low
1	when you go to the 1960 the temps were 84 and when you go to dates higher up you see the actually increase
0	I think its false because if stage 3 froze than i will take more time to unfree.
0	if it did rain since 1960 the sand will be wet
0	I think this claim is true because in Playa the temperature is 85.80 and the turtle is a Female and in Playa the temperature is 80.67 and the turtle is a Male.
1	Normal when the temp is in the 60's they usually are in their chrysalis period of transformation. But one of the chrysalis periods is in the 50 to 59 degree range.
1	I think that wen it gets hotel it seams that the spearhead gross faster as you see in the graf.
1	when the caterpillar is in his chrysalis stage it is hotel but when it is in its normal stage it is ship less worm [OT: graded out rows already coded in Feb13 file]
0	it is true.
0	I think this is true because if it is super cold outside the butter fly will be very cold and might freeze to death.  But if it is to hot the butter fly might die of heat.
0	It's not about the sand temperature it's about if their genes are stronger and their genes determine what gender they are.
0	When we look at the  year, then at the temperature, we can see that in 1960 the temperature was high, but it said that the temperature in Rain Island was decreasing, which means that it was going down.
0	I have made a chart so you can see that I am right because they stated.
1	this fact is false because as i move down the data chart from beginning to end it starts at 33.50 and goes to 909.50 the count of butterfly's in Mexico have gone way up.
1	I think it is partly true and partly false because most of the sand that was 85 or higher were females, and most of the sand that 85 or lower were males. It isn't like this through the whole thing.
1	there has been forest fires in Australia. its been alot hotter there since before the fire
1	the butterfly population has dropped at increasing speeds instead of staying the same, the evidence is in 1996 the butterfly population was 909.50 million and in 2013 it is at 33.50 million.
0	i think that can not fly that fast to my great that are spostohibrnat in a con
0	because over the years the count of butterfly's in mexico had increased and decreased alot
0	I really don't know.
0	When I sorted the data by year(lowest to highest), I found that the amount has increased and then decreased through the years. It has not stay really stayed the same.
0	true because everything ranges from 0 to 900
0	i think it is partly true and partly false because the temperature is dropping down and rising back up from the 1960 to the 2016
0	They have not stayed the same since scientists started keeping track. They actually have decreased by over 300 million the first year and then over 20 million the last year
0	Yes it has because it's been at a constant migration of the protest of the change of the butterfly started at 2020 to 1996.
1	The scientists are saying that the butterfly's population is staying the same but from 1996 to 2013 they have lost loads of butterfly's and the scientists are saying that the butterfly's population in Mexico is staying about the same.
0	most shows that the top is different but they still grow the same
0	I think that it may be true because the highest temperature was a female and the lowest temperatures were all male. But i'm not positive all of the way because when the temperature got to around 84 degrees, it switched into like a pattern of male female male female female and then went onto the rest of the temps witch were only male.
1	I think it is true because a lot of the low temperatures are males and high is mostly female.
1	In Playa most of the females sand temperature is higher than the males sand temperature. Like number 1 Playa 85.80 was a female. then number 8 at Playa 80.67 was a male. So it must make a difference if the temperature of the sand is high or low because almost all of the lower ones are male and most of the higher ones are female.
0	it shows that really no matter what temp it is that any male or female can hatch
1	when the temperature is lower most of the butterfly are still caterpillars and when the temperature is higher most of the butterfly are chrysalis
1	I think that the temperature affects the turtle eggs hatching male or female because as you can see on my graph, most of the lower temperatures are male, and the higher temperatures are female.
0	because in 1960 the temperature was 84.56 in 1994 the temperature was 85.57 as so in 2016
1	it does affect how quickly it goes through the life cycle because there are more chrysalis in the warmer weather so the colder weather makes it harder for them to go through life cycle stages.
1	I think it is false because through the years the population has gone down 100's. For example the population has gone down 876.000 (876 hundredth), from 909.50 to only 33.50. So that is why I think that it is false.
0	I dont know
0	i think its true because it said in the subtitle that this was true.
0	they went up 1 or 2 but some went down 1
1	The temperature of the monarch butterfly's habitat can kind of affect how fast they change if the conditions are to hot they might form faster than if the conditions were cooler. the butterfly's can sometimes be in the sand and if they are lower in the sand they wont get as hot but  the higher up they are in the sand the hotter they will get and might form faster. if they are i sand they can change all kinds of speeds but it can all depends on where they are in the sand.
1	because it is not staying the same actually it is getting lower
0	you need to start at 1993 and count up till 2018
1	In the graph, you can see many of the females were found in Playa and many of the males in Surname. The temperature for the females is mostly high ranging from 88-84. From this, we can make the claim that females spawn in warmer climates. As the males spawn in cooler areas.
1	if anything the temperature has bean going up in stead of down because if you look is goes from 84.56 all the way to 85.57
0	it changed a lot and they were in all kinds of places
1	I do not think it has been decreasing because the graph shows otherwise. The data shows the sand going higher from year to year. In 1960 the temperature of the sand was 84.56, and in 2016 (most resent year on graph) the sand was 85.57. So it was not decreasing at all it was actually increasing.
0	There is no pattern of the population, and the numbers deffenetly aren't the same.
1	After studying the data I conclude that the sea turtles who were born when the sand temperatures were 84 degrees primarily turned out as females. But when the temperatures were 83.99 degrees and below the sea turtle were males.
1	I think this because if you look at the graph, then you can see that the average of female turtles are born in the warmer temperatures and the male turtles are born in the more cold temperatures.
0	I think it is false because if an egg is laying playa sand it can come out as a female or male because if you look at the chart and look at what gender is next to playa sand it will say either female or male, not just male, not not just female. Same to do with the Surname sand.
0	vanessa
1	I say yes because it seems that the male are in the low 80s and that the male also and the female are hatching as female in the high 80s
1	I think this is files because most of the higher the textures are still in the chrysallis stage
0	I think that because the temperature goes higher and lower at all different years. For example, in 1960 the temperature of the sand was 84.56 and in 1962 the temperature was 85.10 which is higher then before.
0	i dont now
0	because  the sand in the summer id most of the time on the top of the sand is hot but on the bottom, it is cool not super cold then     ? do they lay eggs in the winter
1	I think its true because if you look at the data on the chart you can see that male turtles are hatched when the sand temperature is 85.04 and below and the females temperature is  is 85.04 and higher.
1	I think that the second claim is wrong because if you look at the chart close  enough you will see that the butterfly population is increasing in Mexico its not staying the same because if you at the chart under the word count the numbers show that the population is increasing not staying the same.
0	Looking at my data I decided that I would make it into a graph. Then I set the Y axis to sample number and X axis to year then I added a trend line and saw the data going down hugely. It went from 909.50 to 33.50.
0	it is false because i 1960 it was 84.56 degrees, and in 1962 it was 85.10 degrees, so it is not decreasing.
1	The reason why I think it is false is because it the data there is about the same amount of male and female turtles in each location. I also think this because in the data there is not much proof that the temperature affects the gender of the turtle.
0	I think this is false because they are all different temperatures and one of the males temperature is 84.98 and a females is 84.20 so those are almost the same temperature so it does not matter.
0	if anything there over populated
1	i think is is true because the lowest for males to spawn is 80.60 temp and the lowest for females is 84.20 temp so the hotter the sand it will be a female the colder the sand is it going to be a male and that's why the sand temperature affects if it's a male or female
1	I believe that the claim is partly true and partly false because in some parts it shows that maybe the cooler temperatures can change the affects is has on the life cycles but also the temperature is not really changing the affects because there may be a section where a cooler temperature shows that the life cycle is in the caterpillar form then is switches to a chrysalis but it can then switch back to the caterpillar making me believe it is partly true and partly false.
0	"I think that this is incorrect information because it states ""...the monarch butterfly population in mexico has stayed about the same.""However, as you see in my graph, through the years the population has gone anywhere from a bit less than 100 million to 900 million!Due to they scattering of the population I believe that in the past recorded years the population hasn\'t decreased, or increased. It has went back and forth, meaning that it is not only healthy, but that it is going on a natural in predictable course.So, in conclusion, claim #2 is completely incorrect."
0	I think this claim is false because the population has not stayed the same, this is because as the years increase the butterfly number increases to.for example in 1996 there were 33.50 million and fast forward to 2003 there were 556.00 and it just keeps dropping and soon there will be no butterflies.
1	as the years go by they get lesser and lesser from 909 million to 33 million
0	I think this claim is true because if its cold the butterflies are gonna want to be in their Chrysalis. Like when you are cold you wouldn't want to be outside in the cold you want to be raped up in your blanket cause its warmer.
1	the monarch is a caterpillar when it is below 59 degrees and its a chrysalis when it is 59 degrees or higher.  But not always, #3 was a caterpillar while it was 59.36 degrees and #29 was still a cater pillar when it was 60.90 degrees.
0	in 2016 it was only 85.57 and that isn't too far from 1962 and that was only 85.10 there is only 47-degree difference
0	It has not been decreasing because it got higher.
1	if it is warm out it will change faster than if it is cold
0	I think it is kinda true that the population has stayed the same because in the summer i haven't seen alot of them but, their could be alot and i just don't see them so i think it is kinda true and kinda not true.
0	the important info says the tempecher effects the gender.  its right because with my evidence it effects the turtles by gender.it also says that the temp effects the turtles in the story.s
0	In 1996 909.50M butterflies were in Mexico but in 2013 only 33.50 butterflies were in Mexico that is a big difference so it has not stayed about the same.
0	I think this claim is true because the butterfly can't be in the cold or high winds unlike a caterpillar that stays on the ground.
0	sometimes it might be harder to lay eggs and give birth in colder-weather because it might hurt
1	Some males where  born in hot texture same as females. It goes back and forth to say the heat affects the gender, if you say that  the hotter sand has females you would problem wrong  next time some males where born in high texture  thats why its problem false.
0	think that the temper dose not matter as long as the butter file can survive.
1	I think this claim is false because as the years go on the temperatures are not staying about the same. Sometimes one year is millions more than the other. Through out the year it has gone up and down with less millions and more millions. So I believe this claim is false.
0	I think it's partly true and partly false because there are some caterpillars that have not became a chrysalis in the same temperature as the caterpillars that have already became chrysalis.
1	The table shows that lower temperatures are males and higher temperatures are female
1	Yes this is true because I sorted the temps from low to high, and on average the lower temps were all male hatching. and the high temps were all female, so yes there is a correlation between sand temperature and the the gender of the eggs of leatherback turtles.
1	sometimes the female leatherbacks are born around 84 degrees to 87 degrees.
1	In the data if we take the oldest date and the newest date, we will see that the water is accutaully is increasing.
1	"For the first 2 data reports, both ""butterflies"" were outside. 2\'s butterfly was outside in warmer weather, and was a chrysalis already. 1\'s butterfly\'s was in a cooler weather than 2 so warmer weather does speed up the life cycle of a butterfly."
1	I think it is false. So look at the chart at 1960 the temperature is 84.56 but almost every year after that it has been 85 or 86 but some have been 84 but most are higher on 84. But on 1964,1970 and 1972 are all lower but it said that it has been decreasing since 1960 which means every year after that but way more are higher plus the last year is 85.57 which is also higher.
1	I think this claim is true because, when I organized the data by temperature, I saw some patterns. First, when the eggs were in the 54 - 59.36 degree range, they were all caterpillars. Second, when the eggs were in the 59.37 - 60.90 degree range, they were a mixture of caterpillars and chrysalises. Lastly, when the eggs were in the 60.91 - 64 degree range, they were all chrysalises. That is why I think the claim is true. The temperature of a monarch butterfly's habitat does affect how quickly it goes through its life cycle stages.
1	The sand temperature affects whether leather-back eggs hatch as male or female because scientific research proves that when the eggs have been laid in warmer sand, the turtle is a female. When the egg is laid in cooler sand, the turtle is a male. Also, These turtles have been laid in different locations. So we know that in Playa the turtles don't tend to be female. That part is totally random. The Male and Female's were both scattered around Playa and Surname.
1	the temp is increasing
1	I found that the butterflies grow more in warmer weather.   The butterflies in 54 degrees were still in the caterpillar stage.  But in the 62 degree range they were in the chrysalis stage.  That shows they grew more.
1	females only hatch above 85 degrees and males hatch at 85 degrees and lower
1	I think it is true because in the data the lower temperature the more males and the higher temperature the more females.
1	The highest temperatures of sand are normally when females are born. The lowest temperatures are mostly male.
1	i think this claim is true because when the temperature  is warmer most of the butterflies stay inside. When, the temperature is colder most of them stay outside to make there chrysalis.
1	when it is the warmer climates the eggs are female and when the climates are below 85  they are male
1	higher the temperature the more females hatched
1	When I was looking at the evidence, I noticed that all of the males were in sand of the temperature 85.19, and lower. all of the females were born at the temperature of 84.20 and higher. So to conclude the males are born at colder temperatures, and the females were born at slightly warmer temperatures.
1	I think that the graf maps it clear that the populaeshun is going down.
1	The claim is false because I sorted it lowest to highest temperature and the caterpillars was yes, all in one group, but they kept going back 'n' forth. Caterpillar, chrysalis, then back to caterpillars. So therefore the caterpillars will form into papa at different rates in different temperature, however, it changes groups in the same temperature!For instance, 59.36 is in the caterpillar bunch, but, the papa is in 59.54.So maybe temperatures could support faster growth, however, due to the continuous changing i believe that this statement is also incorrect. That is why the statement is partly true, and partly false.
1	I believe that the sand temperature affects whether leatherback eggs hatch as male or female and here's why. because the lower 80s are mostly male the middle temp. 80s are a good mix, and the high 80s are mostly female.
1	I think this is true because if you look at the temperatures 84 degrees and up are all females and if you look at the male temperatures they are all 86 and under.
1	I think the claim is true because the graph shows that the highest temperature shows that the catupiler is in its chrysalis the coldest temperature the butterfly was still a catipiller.
1	The caterpillars all went into their pups when the temperature was 59 degrees (F) or higher.
1	because the butterfly count goes down a lot ever 1 to 2 years
1	when outside it  chrysalis's faster and it's warmer outside
1	In 1968 the temperature was 83.75 and in 2002 the temperature was 86.72 so it was going higher
1	I think the claim is true because outside it is 56.84 degrees  and the butterfly is in the caterpillar stage. The other one says that it is 59.54 degrees and the butterfly in in it's chrysallis stage.
1	If a monarch butter was in a cold temperature area it would take longer because its to cold but if it was really warm the process would go quicker.
1	Why I think it is false is pretty simple. If you look at the table or diagram then it shows in 1960 the temputare of the sand was 84.56 degrees F. And then go 2014 the temputuare is 86.16 degrees F. So that would lead me to believe that the temputuare of the sand is increasing not decreasing.
1	I think this statement is false because I put the temperature in a graph and it seemed to be increasing.
1	The dots on my graph  are all over the place. It goes by the year and count by millions. Some dots are near the bottom and some are near the top. In my chart the numbers range from 33.50 million to 909.50.
1	The temupature since 1860 has been going up until 2000s and started to go down and up.
1	I think that it is false because when it is winter all of the butterfly go to  Mexico. So wen they go there every winter the population will go up.
1	all the females are at a higher tem like 85 butt the males are lower like 80 but some males are at 85 too and some females are as low as 84
1	in the year 2016 the temperature was higher than in 1960
1	Because the monarch butterfly in mexico close to this year is dropping, dropping, and rising, it's never stayed in one place like the tens without bumping up a bit.
1	It has not decreased since 1960 it actually risen a little bit. Because, if you look on the chart 1960 the temperature was 84.56 put then in about ten years it dropped down a little bit but then rose back up, In 2002 the temperature was 86.72. It has risen 1.26 in the temperature.
1	I think this claim is true because when the monarch butterfly was outside and the temperature was at 56.84 it was only a caterpillar. But when a different monarch butterfly was also outside at a temperature of 59.54, it was already  in a chrysalis.
1	the butterfly population has gone down in 1996 it was at 909.50 in. 2013 it is at 33.50.
1	the males are at the bottom and some in the middle, the females are at the top there are three in the middle. Also it said in the beginning that the temperature determines if they are male or female.
1	It has decreased over the years in 1996 it was 909.50 and in 2013 it was 33.50. It has decreased a lot over the years so that statement is false. it almost went down 890.50
1	The chart clearly shows the population decrease from 909 million to 33 million and maybe it is due to natural causes or something happened  on the way
1	I think it is true because male eggs like the sand cooler then female eggs like the sand .The male eggs like 80 to 85 degrees and female like it 84 to 88 degrees.
1	The count overall got smaller.
1	I made a graph to show whether the temperature has been decreasing or not and the graph showed me that the weather has been increasing. So, it is false the weather has not been decreasing
1	When the temperature is higher the butterfly is turning into a chrysalis and soon the chrysalis is turning into a monarch butterfly.
1	In 1960 the sand temperature was 84.56 and in 2016 the sand temperature was 85.57. So clearly it has not been decreasing it has actually been increasing.
1	Every chrysalis tested had a temperature between 59 degrees and 63 degrees. The majority of  the chrysalises were inside.Every caterpillar tested was between 54 and 60 degrees. Most caterpillars were outside. the locations for both were very close between more inside or more outside. Overall, I think it is partially true is because it is true, but the difference in temperature ranges was very small and might not mean anything. Also, the location may or may not have made a difference.
1	from different years it goes up and down but It seems that Its increasing than decreasing. In 2002 and up its going up in heat that getting colder in those years so I presently don't  think its decreasing I think its increasing.
1	in 1960 the temperature was 84.56, but in 2016 the temperature is 85.57. it is going just a little higher
1	One reason why I think that is partly true partly false is if that were true then either 1 or 25 would NOT be the same gender as they are because number 1 (85.80) is only .61 hotter than 25 (85.19). I think it is partly true to because the the data shows Females average 85 and a half maybe more and also shows the Males average 84 and a half so that is why I think that it is partly true and partly false.
1	The graph provided with the investigation shows that commonly the higher temperature sands normally have hatching female turtles unlike hatching male turtles that do their thing in colder sands. Now in the graph, some male turtles hatch in warmer sands than female hatching turtles but not as often as the other way around. I still stick with my decision with true with my reasons conveniently said and the graph for evidence
1	its not the same. the population has jumped around but has gotten smaller. it slowly gets smaller.
1	Most of the chrysalis's are in warmer temps and most of the caterpillars are in cooler temps however, there are a noticeable amount of caterpillars in with  the chrysalis's.
1	I think this is false because the temperatures are around the same number in the 80's.
1	My claim is that the temperature that a chrysalis is in depends on how fast it grows into an adult because, if the temperature is 50 that is not normal for a butterfly to grow in the average temperature is around 60 degrees Fahrenheit. So if it was 50 degrees it would be below what they are used to so it would grow slower.
1	I think that claim 1 is true because when the sand gets hot its most likely that a female will hatch. So when it gets colder some of the males will be born so what I am saying is whenever the sand gets hot a female comes out. Whenever the sand is cold and warm a male will come out.
1	because if it is could the cocoon is cold then it might freeze and when i am outside in the winter i do not see cappella's  or butterfly's. In the summer i think it would be much quicker.
1	Because most of the lower temps. are caterpillars and most of the higher temps. are chrysalis.
1	I think this claim is false because at 1960 it was 84.56. But if you look at my evidence two years after it was 85.10. Through the years the temperature has been getting higher and is not decreasing. Also the temperature got up to 86.72 which has not decreased from 1960. So the temperature of the sand in Rain Island is not decreasing.
1	the population of monarch butterflies has severely gone down from 1996 to 2013
1	Because some male temps are low that means that females are high temps. But some males are quite high in temps.
1	i think it is  true because in this story it said it was faster when it was warm and not when it was cold
1	I think false because, They been going down in the last few years. Also when it goes down also the year is too so this shows something to do with us! Thats why I think its False.
1	I think this claim is true because when the temperature rises, there seem to be more females. between 84.20-85.19 it is kinda scattered but in general, it seems like the lower the temp. the more males, but the higher the temp. the more females. since this claim doesn't go into many specifics, I think we could say yes, the sand temperature affects the gender of the turtles.
1	well most females in the data are born in 85.50 degrees  or more and most males are born below 85.50 degrees. all but 2 females are bore in less 80.50 degrees. and there not 1 male is born in more that 80.50. so its not exactly true but it is party true
1	Look at 1968, 83.75 degrees, and then look at 2016, 85.57 degrees the temperature goes higher not lower.
1	i believe that the sand can affect the gender some times because in the data that shows has the highest temperatures on top with the lowest on bottom and almost all of the high temps are female rather than male one of the highest temps is 88.08 and is female as well as 87.09, 86.97, 86.54, 86.26, those are the highest temps and they are all female the lowest temperature of the female in this test is 84.20 but most of the males is 83.31, 83.25, 82.45, 82.29, the highest of the males in this test is 85.19 quite low to the female turtles. I did say that this thought was partly true/partly false for these reasons
1	because in the hotter temperature the female eggs hatched
1	It hasn't stayed about the same because if you look at the amount of butterflies in 1996 is higher and the number just keeps going down and down over the years.
1	I think the claim is false because in 1960 the temperature was 84.66 on Rain island. Over 58 years it has increased and decreased but in 2018 it has gone up to 85.67.
1	The population went down almost 900 million in only 17 years. The butterfly population went down 13 million in one year. Therefore, the population is going down rapidly!
1	I said what I said because of males where more cornix born in colder places
1	because its going down every year
1	the leather back turtles gender is of the heat the females are mostly hotter than the males. the two that i pointed to were a boy and a girl the girls 5 hotter than the boy
1	I think this claim is true because the caterpillars that were in warmer places have already gone to chrysalis stage. where as the other ones are still in caterpillar stage.
1	I think this claim is false because if you look at the evidence you see that it has barely going up, and it has stayed in the 80's for most of the years.
1	I think that it is true because when the temperature is higher there are mostly chrysalis and when it is colder there are more caterpillars.
1	Lots of the turtles that were raised in a cooler environment were males. A piece of evidence is from 80.60 to 83.85 are all males. The females are manly in the group with higher temperature. For example from 85.42 to 88.08 are all females.
1	The top of the Life Cycle Stage List where it is colder has all caterpillars and at the bottom of the list where it is hotter has a lot of chrysalis's I think that when it is warmer they go threw their stages faster and when it is colder they go threw their stages slower
1	why i believe that tempicher effects weather they are male or female because if you look on the cart most male eggs have lower tepicer and female has higher tempicher that is my reason why
1	When you sort the data from low to high,you can clearly see that the claim is partly true. On the lower side of the chart, it is only male but in the middle some of the temps. Run up to 85.19 address. Which was uncommon for the sex. With is why only part of the claim is true.
1	Well, when I sorted the data by temperature lowest to highest, I looked at the life cycle stages and first there were a chunk of caterpillar  and then chrysalis  then more caterpillars back and fourth. I think that if the claim was true then all the caterpillars would be together and all the chrysalis would be together.
1	I think this question is true because when the temperatures are getting warmer there are lots of chrysalis'. But when it is a little colder out there are mostly caterpillars.
1	on the chart, the temperature has gone not far down and pretty far up. i see that the temp has gone mostly up so it is not decreasing too much.
1	I think it is partly true party false. If you look at the claim it is (the sand temperature affects weather leatherback eggs hatch as male or female.) Then look at the chart male temperature is from 85.19 to 80.60. Then look at female the temperature is from 88.8 to 84.20 so to me it looks like that if there is a higher temperature then there is a female and a lower temperature for a male. But I only think it is partly true partly false because the temperatures 84 and 85 are both in range for them both.
1	I know the temperature of the monarch butterfly's habitat affects how quickly it goes through its life cycle stages is because when I sort the data by cold to hot and most of the hot temperature was the chrysalis meaning they do better in hot places
1	I think that it partially matters what temperature it is for a monarch butterfly to effect how fast it's life cycle goes because when i was looking at the data i noticed that if the temperature was over or at 60.48 then it was more likely to be in a chrysalis.
1	I think this claim is partly true because most of the the ones in the 60's are chrysalises and most of the 50's are not
1	I say that it is false because the weather is staying at the mid 85-88 and that means it is only getting warmer not colder
1	The lower temperature they are in the caterpillar stage and in the higher temperature they are in a chrysalis stage.
1	I think this claim is true because whether sea turtles lay there eggs in the sand and the different temperatures that effect in there eggs shell could change there formation of themselves. To turn into to a male or female. Also I notice that the temperatures stay in the eighties maybe  that also has something to do with it. Males usually in Surname tend to stat around in under the 85's but females on the other hand stay above an 85 maybe that's a reason the come out male or female.
1	when i shorter the years i  the new one is the hottest with 85.57 and the last is 84.56
1	I think it's partly true/partly false because from the data outside is kind of warmer then inside and in the higher temperatures the monarchs are already at the chrysalis stage. In the article it said that monarchs move to warmer places in the winter. Places that are not to cold and not to warm. But I also think it is partly false too because looking at the data some monarchs that are inside are in chrysalis.
1	I think the claim is false because in 1996 the butterfly population is 909.50 million and in 2013 the butterfly population is 33.50 million and there is a big difference in 33.50 million and 909.50 million. So the butterfly population has gone down a lot
1	I see that the males mostly hatch in a little colder sand. I also see that the females are mostly born in sand that is a little bit warmer then the males. I think that the fact is partly true because that is not true for some of the turtles.
1	I think true because if a monarch butterfly's habitat is cold then it  will not be able to transfer throw out all of the other stages in its life cycle, but if a monarch butterfly's habitat is warm then it will be able to transfer throw the stages. Just like if a human goes out side in the cold then the fluids inside of your body will not stay warm, but if you are inside and it is warm inside then the fluids in your body will keep running faster throw out your body.
1	I think this claim is false because if you see on the data when monarch butterfly's  are inside they can be a caterpillar or a chrysalis. But on the outside it shows that it can be the same as the indoor. Also as you can see lower temperatures and higher temperatures can both be caterpillars or chrysalis's. So I don't believe the temperature affects them or the habitat.
1	When the sand temperature is hotter the eggs hatch as female, and when the sand is cooler the eggs hatch as male. For example, some of the male egg temperature were, 80.60, 82.45, and 83.25. But then some of the female temperatures were, 87.09, 88.08 and 86.54, so there is a big difference in those temperatures which means that the eggs hatch as female when the sand is hotter, and the eggs hatch as male when the sand is cooler.
1	The highest temperature was in 2002. The lowest temperature was in 1968. On my graph the temperature was going up and down not just a line going down. If anything the temperature is going up for 1960.
1	When the temperature is higher its seems to male it slower because all of the chrysalis is 59 degrees or above and all of the caterpillars are 60 degrees and under. The chrysalis stage comes first and is all a higher temp than the caterpillars stage is after the chrysalis stage and is a lowe temp.
1	i think that this is partly true because the article said that the weather cant be too cold and cant be to warm. i think this could affect how they grow, if the monarch butterfly are in too warm of weather they could not grow properly. if they are in too cold of weather they could take longer to grow, or even worst die. i do agree that it can cause them to to grow. if monarch butterfly are in to warm or harsh weather it could cause the population to go down in stead of up. that is why i think climate can cause butterfly to not grow.
1	We believe this is false because since 1960 the temperatures have risen.
1	I am seeing that the life cycle In affected by the temp. of their habitat.Some evidence that my claim is true is that 60 Degrees *f is when they start turning in to caterpillars but over 60 is chryalises.
1	Some are saying that the temperature of the sand in Rain Island, Australia has been decreasing since 1960. This information is incorrect. As I have made my graph of data that has been collected from the past years, I have found that the temperatures have gone up since 1960, not gone down.
1	I think it is not true because it side it was decreasing when it has been going up for the most part it only goes down a little bit!
1	i think this claim is partly true and false because monarch count has stayed in the millions but the numbers have gone way lower. since 1996
1	The claim is false because in 1996 their where 909.5 million butterfly's in Mexico. But in 2008 the butterfly population has gone down to 253 million and it decreased from there. Until 2013 where there was only 33.5 million butterfly's in Mexico so it is pretty obvious that the claim is false because the butterfly population went down 876 million in 17 years.
1	We believe the temperature of the sand does contribute to male or female eggs.  Male's were primarily hatched in the low 80's to 83 range.  Females were primarily hatched in the 85 - 88 range.
1	In 1960 Temperature was 84.56 and in 2016 the Temperature was 85.57 so it increased.
1	according to the chart higher temperatures seem to have female eggs and lower the temperatures seem to have more male. but in the middle of the chart mae and female are a little mixed up.
1	i think this claim is false because the data table shows that as years go on the population have been increasing and decreasing. Also thats happening because butterflies go there when it gets to cold or to hot where they live and it degrees when they leave to go somewhere else.
1	As I quickly looked through the location, and went onto temperature where I looked and saw that mainly the monarch butterfly does turn into the chrysalis quicker at hotter temperatures whether inside or outside.
1	When you look at the chart pay attention to the numbers of the population. It was going downward! In 1993 the population was 3 million to 1996, 9 million now look at 2013, 33 million! It was in the hundred million not 10 million! You can not say it has stayed the same when it fell down to 10 million. I think the claim is False!
1	I think that it is partially true because it shows that the warmer the temperature the faster it will grow but, I believe this only goes for when the caterpillar is outside because it seems that when a caterpillar is inside it doesn't grow as quickly because  it's not in it's natural habitat.
1	I think this claim is partly true and partly false. I think this because if you look at the males most of them have lower temperatures than the females. Most males are 85 to 80 for their temperatures. As you see most females are 85 and up. But some males are higher than 85 and some females are lower than 85. But as you see most females are higher than 85 and most males are lower than 85.
1	when the feature became hotter and more dense the butterfly started going through the cycles of their transformation
1	I think this claim is true because all the females numbers are within a couple of numbers of each other. And it is the same for male.I think this because in the data it says on one piece of evidence that it was 85.82 degrees and it was a female then another one said 85.54 and that was a female. another reason i think this is because in the data it says 80.56 and it was a male then another one said 80.60 and that was a male to.in conclusion I think claim 1 is true.
1	After 11 days there were more chrysalises when it was warmer and more caterpillars as it got colder. So warmer temps make the monarch butterfly's life cycle go faster.
1	Most of the male eggs are hatched in cooler weather, however most of the female eggs are in a little bit warmer weather
1	The highest count of butterfly was in 1996 and ever since then it has dropped rapidly over the past 17 years. And it has dropped by over 800 million, so it has not been staying the same.
1	In the data shown in the picture it looks like the lower the temperature the slower the life cycle is.The data also shows the higher the temperature the faster the life cycle is.
1	I think this claim is partly true and false because the monarch count has stayed in the millions but the numbers have increasingly have gone way lower sense 1996.
1	In 1962 the temperature was at 85.10 degrees. and you keep going up in years the temperature goes up and down depending on the weather. In 2008 the temperature was at 85.21. That is a increase if anything in the temperature. it was a 0.11 increase in heat.
1	If your looking at the chart, the females temperature is much higher than the males but, some of the temperatures are the same for both the genders. Thats why I think its partly true.
1	If you look at the years under the year 2000 they have all smaller temperatures than the sand in the 2000's. So that means that the temperature increased actually.
1	The sand temperature affects whether leatherback eggs hatch as male or female because looking at the data, males have lower temperatures while the females have more.
1	i think it's false because it says they started tracking in 1993 and from 1993 to 2013 the population has gone down instead of staying the same it went from 909 million to 33 million.This is why i think that the monarch butterfly's population didn't stay the same.
1	The lower the temperature is, the slower the life cycle goes.
1	as the temperature ranged from 57-62 the caterpillars turned into stage 3 crysiless depending on the location this could be caused by humidity outside or inside but as it got warmer they changed mostly on the warmer side inside and a little cooler outside again probably from humidity
1	because some are a high temperature and the monarchs are still caterpillars but some of the low temperatures are chrysalises
1	All higher temperatures above 59.50 are in stage 3 or 4 because of how high the temperature is in there location. But just 6 of them are still in stage 2 though.I have thought about it and came up with this theory, they may have been born just went the temperature was warmer and they still are growing fast but just have not made the cut.
1	because most of the time there are male and female sometimes there are just female and sometimes the a just males because male need to be colder to the ground or the won't be a male they will then be a female. female need to be warmer than the males if there to cold they will most likely to be a male
1	every year since 1996 the monarch butterfly population has gone down every time a new year comes so the butterfly population cannot be the same if in 1996 909.50 million butterflies and the in 2013 there are only 33.50 million they have gone down by about 878 million
1	The temperature for male eggs was between 80-86, which is lower than the 84-87 that the female eggs had. I believe that if the egg is warmer, females will hatch. If it's colder, males will hatch.
1	The monarch butterfly population has decreased by millions. The amount in 1996 909.50, to 2013 33.50. That was a HG decrease in population. I should have their job because I even know that.
1	the weather makes the monarch slow done if it is to cold out they stay as caterpillars and when it is hot they grow up faster. They grow faster if they eat more.they grow slow if it is 61 to 54 farinhitemost of these are still caterpillars because it is still cold
1	i think its partly true and partly false because number 1 and  2 are both 85 degrees and one is male and ones female but numbers 19 and 20 is a big different 19 is 80 degrees and its a male and 20 is 86 degrees and a female
1	all of the chrysalis are 60 or above and all of the caterpillar are below 59
1	in the lower temperature there are mainly males till 84.20 then it is mixed till 85.42 where the rest are al female
1	I think its partly true/ partly false because in some parts it's colder than the warm temperature and it still said chrysalis.
1	If you look at the temperatures from lowest to highest, you see that all the lowest temperatures say caterpillar and the higher temperatures say chrysalis. This shows that the temperature of the habitat affects how quickly monarch butterfly's life cycle stages change.
1	In 1996 the count was 909.50 million and just a year after it dropped to 630.50 and all the way up in 2013 the count was 33.50 million so it has dropped about 880 million.
1	The higher temperature are mostly female and the lower temperature are mostly male. I said partly true partly false because some male sea turtles are high temperatures and some female sea turtles are in the lower temperatures.
1	Each year the count goes done
1	As you can see in the data...over the years the butterfly population in Mexico has changed. There were way more butterflies in the 90's. in the 2000's the numbers died down , but in the early and late 2010's it slowly started rising again.
1	The temperature was going up.
1	yes because of its temporal is raising.
1	when you go to the 1960 the temps were 84 and when you go to dates higher up you see the actually increase
1	Normal when the temp is in the 60's they usually are in their chrysalis period of transformation. But one of the chrysalis periods is in the 50 to 59 degree range.
1	I think that wen it gets hotel it seams that the spearhead gross faster as you see in the graf.
1	when the caterpillar is in his chrysalis stage it is hotel but when it is in its normal stage it is ship less worm [OT: graded out rows already coded in Feb13 file]
1	this fact is false because as i move down the data chart from beginning to end it starts at 33.50 and goes to 909.50 the count of butterfly's in Mexico have gone way up.
1	I think it is partly true and partly false because most of the sand that was 85 or higher were females, and most of the sand that 85 or lower were males. It isn't like this through the whole thing.
1	there has been forest fires in Australia. its been alot hotter there since before the fire
1	the butterfly population has dropped at increasing speeds instead of staying the same, the evidence is in 1996 the butterfly population was 909.50 million and in 2013 it is at 33.50 million.
1	The scientists are saying that the butterfly's population is staying the same but from 1996 to 2013 they have lost loads of butterfly's and the scientists are saying that the butterfly's population in Mexico is staying about the same.
1	I think it is true because a lot of the low temperatures are males and high is mostly female.
1	In Playa most of the females sand temperature is higher than the males sand temperature. Like number 1 Playa 85.80 was a female. then number 8 at Playa 80.67 was a male. So it must make a difference if the temperature of the sand is high or low because almost all of the lower ones are male and most of the higher ones are female.
1	when the temperature is lower most of the butterfly are still caterpillars and when the temperature is higher most of the butterfly are chrysalis
1	I think that the temperature affects the turtle eggs hatching male or female because as you can see on my graph, most of the lower temperatures are male, and the higher temperatures are female.
1	it does affect how quickly it goes through the life cycle because there are more chrysalis in the warmer weather so the colder weather makes it harder for them to go through life cycle stages.
1	I think it is false because through the years the population has gone down 100's. For example the population has gone down 876.000 (876 hundredth), from 909.50 to only 33.50. So that is why I think that it is false.
1	The temperature of the monarch butterfly's habitat can kind of affect how fast they change if the conditions are to hot they might form faster than if the conditions were cooler. the butterfly's can sometimes be in the sand and if they are lower in the sand they wont get as hot but  the higher up they are in the sand the hotter they will get and might form faster. if they are i sand they can change all kinds of speeds but it can all depends on where they are in the sand.
1	because it is not staying the same actually it is getting lower
1	In the graph, you can see many of the females were found in Playa and many of the males in Surname. The temperature for the females is mostly high ranging from 88-84. From this, we can make the claim that females spawn in warmer climates. As the males spawn in cooler areas.
1	if anything the temperature has bean going up in stead of down because if you look is goes from 84.56 all the way to 85.57
1	I do not think it has been decreasing because the graph shows otherwise. The data shows the sand going higher from year to year. In 1960 the temperature of the sand was 84.56, and in 2016 (most resent year on graph) the sand was 85.57. So it was not decreasing at all it was actually increasing.
1	After studying the data I conclude that the sea turtles who were born when the sand temperatures were 84 degrees primarily turned out as females. But when the temperatures were 83.99 degrees and below the sea turtle were males.
1	I think this because if you look at the graph, then you can see that the average of female turtles are born in the warmer temperatures and the male turtles are born in the more cold temperatures.
1	I say yes because it seems that the male are in the low 80s and that the male also and the female are hatching as female in the high 80s
1	I think this is files because most of the higher the textures are still in the chrysallis stage
1	I think its true because if you look at the data on the chart you can see that male turtles are hatched when the sand temperature is 85.04 and below and the females temperature is  is 85.04 and higher.
1	I think that the second claim is wrong because if you look at the chart close  enough you will see that the butterfly population is increasing in Mexico its not staying the same because if you at the chart under the word count the numbers show that the population is increasing not staying the same.
1	The reason why I think it is false is because it the data there is about the same amount of male and female turtles in each location. I also think this because in the data there is not much proof that the temperature affects the gender of the turtle.
1	i think is is true because the lowest for males to spawn is 80.60 temp and the lowest for females is 84.20 temp so the hotter the sand it will be a female the colder the sand is it going to be a male and that's why the sand temperature affects if it's a male or female
1	I believe that the claim is partly true and partly false because in some parts it shows that maybe the cooler temperatures can change the affects is has on the life cycles but also the temperature is not really changing the affects because there may be a section where a cooler temperature shows that the life cycle is in the caterpillar form then is switches to a chrysalis but it can then switch back to the caterpillar making me believe it is partly true and partly false.
1	as the years go by they get lesser and lesser from 909 million to 33 million
1	the monarch is a caterpillar when it is below 59 degrees and its a chrysalis when it is 59 degrees or higher.  But not always, #3 was a caterpillar while it was 59.36 degrees and #29 was still a cater pillar when it was 60.90 degrees.
1	if it is warm out it will change faster than if it is cold
1	Some males where  born in hot texture same as females. It goes back and forth to say the heat affects the gender, if you say that  the hotter sand has females you would problem wrong  next time some males where born in high texture  thats why its problem false.
1	I think this claim is false because as the years go on the temperatures are not staying about the same. Sometimes one year is millions more than the other. Through out the year it has gone up and down with less millions and more millions. So I believe this claim is false.
